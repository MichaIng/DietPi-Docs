## Introduction

This is the source code repository for the [DietPi Documentation website](https://dietpi.com/docs/).
It uses extended Markdown, as implemented by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/michaing/dietpi-docs/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/michaing/dietpi-docs)

## Building the documentation

- Install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- From the root directory, run: `mkdocs serve`

It builds the static HTML pages into a temporary directory and starts a local web server at `http://localhost:8000`. If you have troubles accessing the MkDocs website, you could also listen on a specific IP address or all IP addresses, e.g. `mkdocs serve -a 0.0.0.0:8000`.

## Contributing

There are many ways you could contribute to DietPi project. You could work on the DietPi project, extend the documentation, or just run different tests.
