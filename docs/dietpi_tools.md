=== "Software Optimised"

    - Begin by selecting **Software Optimized** in the main menu list and hit Enter.

    - Scroll through the list of available software - for more details check [DietPi Optimised Software](../dietpi_optimised_software/).

    The list of optimised software is long. You either browse the list or use the option **Search**.

    - To install software on your DietPi, select it in the list and press the **space bar** to add it to the installation list. If you change your mind, hit space again to remove it.

    - Once youâ€™ve selected the software you wish to install, press the tab key on your keyboard to switch to the confirmation options at the bottom. Select **OK**, then hit enter on your keyboard to confirm.

    - To begin installing your software, select **Install** from the main menu list, then hit the Enter key. DietPi will ask you to confirm your choice(s). Select **OK**, then hit enter to begin the installation.

    The software you selected will begin to install at this point. Once the process is completed, you may be asked to restart your device. Press **OK** to confirm.

=== "Software Additional"

    This section provides:

    - software packages that are often used and installed via `apt install <package>`, without additional optimisation from DietPi team.
    - _or_ packages not directly required, but pulled as a dependency, like: build tools, libraries or runtime systems.

You can return to the **DietPi-Software** tool to make further changes at any time by typing `dietpi-software` at the terminal, or enter `dietpi-launcher` and select **DietPi-Software** tool.

**Install**  
Install selected software item(s), and these could come both from **optimised software** list or **additional software** items.
