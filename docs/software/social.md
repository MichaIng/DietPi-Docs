        - Click "New"
        - Enter the IPv4 address of your DietPi device, the username and password you entered during the OpenBazaar server install
        - Turn off SSL, unless you manually enabled it, including TLS certificate setup

=== "Configuration"

    - Config and data directory:  
        `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/openbazaar`
    - Main config file:  
        `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/openbazaar/config`

    For changes to take effect, the service needs to be restarted:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart openbazaar
    ```

=== "Service handling"

    The DietPi OpenBazaar implementation creates a systemd service `openbazaar.service` to start and control the OpenBazaar server. The following commands can be used:

    - Stop: `systemctl stop openbazaar`
    - Restart: `systemctl restart openbazaar`

## Synapse

Synapse is a server, written in Python, for communication using the Matrix protocol.

=== "Client"

    For communicating with Synapse, you can use [Element](https://element.io/), however any client that supports the Matrix protocol should work.

=== "Federation"

    Synapse is by default set up to be a private server, with no connection to any other servers. To connect to other servers (federate), see https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/federate.md.  Note that frp does not currently work with Synapse.

=== "Configuration"

    - Config directory:  
        `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/synapse`
    - Main config file:  
        `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/synapse/homeserver.yaml`
    - DietPi config override:  
        `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/synapse/homeserver.yaml.d/00-dietpi.yaml`  
        This also contains the PostgreSQL database details and that file is hence only readable to root or the `synapse` user.

    To add or change settings, best practice is to create a new override configuration, e.g.:

    ```
    /mnt/dietpi_userdata/synapse/homeserver.yaml.d/99-local.yaml
    ```

    For changes to take effect, the service needs to be reloaded:

    ```sh
    systemctl reload synapse
    ```

=== "Service handling"

    The DietPi Synapse implementation creates a systemd service `synapse.service` to start and control the Synapse server. The following commands can be used:

    - Start: `systemctl start synapse`
    - Stop: `systemctl stop synapse`
    - Restart: `systemctl restart synapse`
    - Reload config: `systemctl reload synapse`
    - Print status: `systemctl status synapse`

=== "View logs"

    Logs are done to the system journal an can be viewed via:

    ```sh
    journalctl -u synapse
    ```

=== "Update to latest version"

    Since Synapse is installed via Python 3 pip, you can update it via:

    ```sh
    pip3 install -U matrix-synapse
    ```
