## Synapse

Synapse is a server, written in Python, for communication using the Matrix protocol.

=== "Client"

    For communicating with Synapse, you can use [Element](https://element.io/), however any client that supports the Matrix protocol should work.

=== "Federation"

    Synapse is by default set up to be a private server, with no connection to any other servers. To connect to other servers (federate), see <https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/federate.md>.  
    Note that [frp](../advanced_networking/#frp) does not currently work with Synapse.

=== "Configuration"

    - Config directory:  
        `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/synapse`
    - Main config file:  
        `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/synapse/homeserver.yaml`
    - DietPi config override:  
        `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/synapse/homeserver.yaml.d/00-dietpi.yaml`  
        This also contains the PostgreSQL database details and that file is hence only readable to root or the `synapse` user.

    To add or change settings, best practice is to create a new override configuration, e.g.:

    ```
    /mnt/dietpi_userdata/synapse/homeserver.yaml.d/99-local.yaml
    ```

    For changes to take effect, the service needs to be reloaded:

    ```sh
    systemctl reload synapse
    ```

=== "Service handling"

    The DietPi Synapse implementation creates a systemd service `synapse.service` to start and control the Synapse server. The following commands can be used:

    - Start: `systemctl start synapse`
    - Stop: `systemctl stop synapse`
    - Restart: `systemctl restart synapse`
    - Reload config: `systemctl reload synapse`
    - Print status: `systemctl status synapse`

=== "View logs"

    Logs are done to the system journal an can be viewed via:

    ```sh
    journalctl -u synapse
    ```

=== "Update to latest version"

    Since Synapse is installed via Python 3 pip, you can update it via:

    ```sh
    pip3 install -U matrix-synapse
    ```

## microblog.pub

A self-hosted, single-user, ActivityPub powered microblog.

![microblog.pub blog screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-social-microblogpub1.jpg){: width="400" height="337" loading="lazy"}

=== "Installation / configuration"

    The software installs automatically with a default config. Therefore it is necessary to reconfigure it using the `microblog-pub` script, which loads the environment, and brings up the app's own configuration wizard.  
    This circumstance is signalled with the following dialog at the end of the installation process:

    ![microblog.pub installation screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-social-microblogpub2.jpg){: width="640" height="142" loading="lazy"}

    To execute this reconfiguration, you can enter the following commands:

    ```sh
    exec bash
    ```

    This starts a new bash where you can execute the configuration script

    ```sh
    microblog-pub configure
    ```
 
    Remark: You can also easily reboot your system and then execute the `microblog-pub configure` command without the `bash` command before.

    ???+ warning "Setting the port number during the reconfiguration process"

        During the reconfiguration via `microblog-pub configure` you are asked - amongst others - for your domain.  
        Do not forget to add a `:8007`

=== "Configuration file"

    The `microblog.pub` configuration file is named `profile.toml`  
    and is located there: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/microblog-pub/data/profile.toml`.  

    In case of a full reconfiguration you need to delete this file before starting the `microblog-pub configure` command.
