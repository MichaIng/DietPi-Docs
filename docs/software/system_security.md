??? info "How do I run **DietPi-Software** and install **optimised software** ?"
    To install any of the **DietPi optimised software** listed below run from the command line:

    ```
    dietpi-software
    ```

    Choose **Software Optimised** and select one or more items. Finally click on `Install`. DietPi will do all the necessary steps to install and start these software items.

## Let’s Encrypt & Certbot - Enable HTTPS / SSL

Let's Encrypt is a free SSL certificate provider. Certbot is the official client to apply Let's Encrypt SSL certificates to your webserver. This will allow you to have `https://` (encrypted and authenticated) access to your websites.

### Requirements

To use Certbot you need:

- A working Apache2, Nginx or Lighttpd webserver
- A URL/domain (e.g.: `mysite.org`). No-IP can be used for a URL/domain that points to your device.
- Ports 80 and 443 (TCP) need to be forwarded to your device. This is typically set within your router.

???+ important "Keep port 80 open for Certbot renewal"
    Even when you use only HTTPS on port 443, Let's Encrypt requires port 80 to stay opened for certificate renewals (in your router's forwarding functionality).

### Create and apply your cert

Once Certbot has been installed from `dietpi-software`, run `dietpi-letsencrypt` to configure, create and apply your SSL certificate:

```sh
dietpi-letsencrypt
```

Simply enter the details and settings you require, then select `Apply`.  
Let's Encrypt is that simple!

## Fail2Ban - Protects your system from brute-force attacks

Fail2Ban protects your system from brute-force attacks by banning the source IP address.  
We have enabled detection for SSH servers (OpenSSH and Dropbear), however, Fail2Ban also supports additional software.

An IP address is by default ban triggered after 3 failed SSH login attempts. Fail2Ban will ban the source IP address for 10 minutes.

=== "Check status of block activity"

    The status can be checked with these commands:

    - `fail2ban-client status sshd`
    - `fail2ban-client status dropbear`

=== "Enable support for additional programs"

    Fail2Ban supports brute-force protection for other software (e.g. Apache, ProFTPD etc).  
    You can enable/disable these features by modifying the */etc/fail2ban/jail.conf* file, and setting `enable = true` under the *[software]* name.

## Docker - Build, ship, and run distributed applications

Docker is used to build, ship, and run distributed applications.

=== "Access logs"

    Access logs can be viewed with this command: `journalctl -u docker -u containerd`

=== "Config files"

    The Docker configuration files are:

    - Docker: `/etc/docker/daemon.json`
    - containerd: `/etc/containerd/config.toml`
