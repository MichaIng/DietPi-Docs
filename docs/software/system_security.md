## Fail2Ban - Protects your system from brute-force attacks

Fail2Ban protects your system from brute-force attacks by banning the source IP address.  
We have enabled detection for SSH servers (OpenSSH and Dropbear), however, Fail2Ban also supports additional software.

An IP address is by default ban triggered after 3 failed SSH login attempts. Fail2Ban will ban the source IP address for 10 minutes.

=== "Check status of block activity"

    The status can be checked with these commands:

    - `fail2ban-client status sshd`
    - `fail2ban-client status dropbear`

=== "Enable support for additional programs"

    Fail2Ban supports brute-force protection for other software (e.g. Apache, ProFTPD etc).  
    You can enable/disable these features by modifying the */etc/fail2ban/jail.conf* file, and setting `enable = true` under the *[software]* name.
