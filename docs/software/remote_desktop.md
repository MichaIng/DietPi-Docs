## [29] TigerVNC Server - Desktop for remote connection

!!! info Desktop environment

    From the list of **Optimised Software**, together with any of the Remote Desktop Software choose also one of [_Graphical Desktop environment_](../desktop). DietPi will install both of them, enabling you to use your keyboard and mouse to interact with a graphical desktop environment on your device.

Run a **Desktop environment** on your device and access it accessed remotely via network. It is a great option for headless SBC devices.

=== "Quick start"

    You can control the VNC service with:
    ```
    systemctl status vncserver.service
    ```

    Connection Details:

    - Use the IP address of your DietPi device (e.g.: `192.168.0.100`). If you can't connect, try connecting to screen 1 (e.g.: `192.168.0.100:1`)
    - Use the password you entered during the installation. If you would like to change the password run from the console/terminal
    ```
    vncpasswd
    ```
    - The default port is 5901. **Note:** To enable access from outside of your local network, this port needs to be forwarded from your router.

=== "Enable autostart"

    VNC servers start automatically during boot, unless you have selected **Desktop** from `dietpi-autostart` configuration tool.

    To enable a different startup setup, run from the command line the main DietPi tool:
    ```
    dietpi-launcher
    ```
    or directly.
    ```
    dietpi-autostart
    ```
    To see all the DietPi configurations options, review [DietPi Tools](../../dietpi_tools) section.

### VNC Server - Shared desktop

```
nano /boot/dietpi.txt
```

A running desktop is required in this mode, please set desktop to start from boot:
