## TigerVNC Server

![DietPi remote desktop software TigerVNC](../assets/images/dietpi-software-remote-desktop-tigervnc.jpg){: style="width:600px"}

=== "Quick start"

    You can monitor the VNC service with:

    ```
    systemctl status vncserver
    ```

    Although any VNC viewer may work, the latest official TigerVNC viewer can be downloaded here: <https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/tigervnc/>

    #### Connection Details

    - Use the IP address of your DietPi device, e.g.: `192.168.0.100`.  
      If you can't connect, try connecting to screen `1`, e.g.: `192.168.0.100:1`.
    - Use the password you entered during the installation. If you would like to change the password execute from the console/terminal, run `vncpasswd`.
    - The default port is **5901**.  
      **Note:** To enable access from outside of your local network, this port needs to be forwarded from your router.

=== "Config options"

    #### Shared desktop

    The *shared desktop* mode is used to have more than one single VNC viewer connected to the same desktop session. To enable this mode, edit **/boot/dietpi.txt**, e.g. via `nano /boot/dietpi.txt`.
    Change to value `1` the following line:

    ```
    SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_SHARE_DESKTOP=1
    ```

    A running desktop is required for this mode, therefore enable desktop autostart via `dietpi-autostart 2`, or assure that a local desktop session is active before starting TigerVNC manually.

    #### Resolution settings

    The following shows an example how to run VNC server on screen **:1** by creating a new desktop with 1280x720 resolution by editing **/boot/dietpi.txt**:

    ```
    nano /boot/dietpi.txt
    ```

    and change the following settings:

    ```
    SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_WIDTH=1280
    SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_HEIGHT=720
    SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_DEPTH=32
    SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_DISPLAY_INDEX=1
    ```

    At last restart the service to activate the new settings:

    ```
    systemctl restart vncserver
    ```

=== "Autostart"

    TigerVNC is enabled by default to start automatically at boot. Run `systemctl disable vncserver` to disable this behaviour and `systemctl start vncserver` to start it manually from console.

    To re-enabled TigerVNC autostart, run `systemctl enable vncserver`, to stop it manually `systemctl stop vncserver` can be used.

## RealVNC Server

RealVNC consists of the *VNC Server* and the *VNC Viewer* application to share the desktop or control the computer running the VNC Server.

![DietPi remote desktop software RealVNC](../assets/images/dietpi-software-remotedesktop-realvnc.png){: style="width:600px"}

=== "VNC Server modes"

    #### Basics

    By default DietPi will start a virtual VNC session on boot at screen **:1** for user **root**.  
    The screen index can be changed via `SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_DISPLAY_INDEX` in `/boot/dietpi.txt`.
    Logs can be viewed via `journalctl -t Xvnc:1 -t vncserver` and in `/root/.vnc/`.
    When you logout (instead of only closing the VNC Viewer window), the session will exit. Restart it via `systemctl restart vncserver`.

    #### Shared desktop

    If you set `SOFTWARE_VNCSERVER_SHARE_DESKTOP=1` in /boot/dietpi.txt or select desktop auto login via `dietpi-autostart` (index 2), RealVNC server will be started on boot in shared desktop mode, attaching to the first found local desktop session.  
    Check the service status via `systemctl status vncserver-x11-serviced`.
    Check all logs via `journalctl -u vncserver-x11-serviced`.

    #### RealVNC enterprise subscription

    If you have an enterprise subscription on RealVNC, you can have virtual VNC sessions spawning automatically on demand per-client connection and closing once the client disconnects. That way no resource-intense X11/desktop session needs to be persistently active on the server to allow VNC connections.  
    To enable this, after adding your enterprise subscription credentials, do the following:

    - `systemctl disable --now vncserver` disables the persistent virtual VNC session on screen **:1**.
    - `systemctl enable --now vncserver-virtuald` enables the on demand VNC session daemon.

=== "Setup the VNC Viewer"

    Simply select a VNC viewer for your system and download: <https://www.realvnc.com/connect/download/viewer/>

    #### Connection details

    - To connect on the persistent VNC session on screen :1, add the screen index to your local IP or hostname, e.g. `192.168.0.100:1`.
    - To connect to a shared desktop session, skip the screen index, e.g. `192.168.0.100`.
    - Username = `root`
    - Password = `<root password>` (default: `dietpi`)

=== "Running directly rendered apps"

     This may be the case e.g. if you want to run Minecraft remotely.

    - Enable shared desktop mode:
        - Run `dietpi-autostart 2` to autostart into a desktop session and have RealVNC attached to it automatically.
        - Then `reboot` the system to have the changes taking effect.
    - Follow the instructions within the section *Running directly rendered apps such as Minecraft remotely* in <https://www.realvnc.com/docs/raspberry-pi.html>.

## XRDP

XRDP is a remote desktop application using the *Windows Remote Desktop Client*.

![DietPi remote desktop software XRDP](../assets/images/dietpi-software-remotedesktop-xrdp.png){: style="width:600px"}

=== "Connect to your desktop"

    To connect to the desktop, open the remote desktop application in Windows (or any other XRDP compatible client).  
    Enter the IP address of your DietPi device (e.g.: 192.168.0.100).  
    Click connect and enter the following details once connected:

    - Module = `Xvnc` (Jessie = `Sesman-Xvnc`)
    - Username = `root`
    - Password = `dietpi`

=== "Access from outside your local network"

    XRDP uses port **3389** by default, so you need to open/forward it from your router to DietPi.

## NoMachine

NoMachine is a remote desktop server with advanced features, such as screen recording. The client also scans for all available NoMachine servers on your network, allowing easy connection and maintenance of your remote desktops.

![DietPi remote desktop software NoMachine](../assets/images/dietpi-software-remotedesktop-nomachine.png){: style="width:600px"}

=== "Download NoMachine Client"

    Download the *NoMachine* client software from:

    - URL = <https://www.nomachine.com>

=== "Connect to DietPi"

    Once the NoMachine client is installed, and running on your system, you should see a device named *DietPi*. Execute the following steps:

    1. Double click it.
    2. Select `Yes` for *Remote host identification has changed*.
    3. Select `Yes` for *Verify host authenticity*.
    4. Enter the username `root` and password `dietpi`.
    5. Select `Yes` for *Do you want NoMachine to create a new display*.

    You will now be connected to your device.

## Remot3.it

Remot3.it allows you to easily access your DietPi device over the internet.

![DietPi remote desktop software Remot3.it](../assets/images/dietpi-software-remotedesktop-remot3it.png){: style="width:600px"}

Weaved works by connecting you to a specific TCP port on your device, all of which can be customized during first run setup.

Examples of TCP ports for Remot3.it:

- SSH port 22. Open a remote terminal to your device.
- Transmission port 9091. Monitor your BitTorrent downloads.
- Webserver port 80. Access your internal webserver and/or websites.

=== "First Run Setup"

    The first run setup is executed once `dietpi-software` has completed the installation and the system is rebooted. Run the following command. Follow the onscreen instructions to setup and link an account:

    ```
    connectd_installer
    ```

    Once your account is created and linked to this system, you can select a port for Remot3.it to enable remote access.

=== "Access your device"

    Sign into your Remot3.it account to access your devices remotely:

    - URL = <https://www.remote.it>

## VirtualHere

The VirtualHere package is used to share physically attached USB devices from your SBC over the network to other systems.

![DietPi remote desktop software VirtualHere](../assets/images/dietpi-software-remotedesktop-virtualhere.png){: style="width:600px"}

Download the client for your PC from:

- <https://www.virtualhere.com/usb_client_software>

Once installed, available VirtualHere devices will be shown in the client user interface and can be used on the client PC.

!!! warning "USB Storage WARNING"
    - As per <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/852#issuecomment-292781475> it it highly recommended that you do not install VirtualHere if your DietPi user data is stored on a USB drive.
    - VirtualHere does not take into account mounted drives when selecting them for remote use. This is potentially dangerous for any mounted drive that is in use and may cause data loss.
    - Do not use drives on the client that are mounted on the SBC.  
      Unmount the drive before hand in `dietpi-drive_manager`.
