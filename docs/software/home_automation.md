## Home Assistant

Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform running on Python 3. Track and control all devices at home and automate control. Perfect to run on a Raspberry Pi.

=== "Initial install and access"

    The install process on slower SBC models can take a very long time, up to 2 hours, hence take a coffee, find some other activity and check back once in a while. It will show Installing Python-3.x.x... a very long time.  
    If you want to see processing details, run `htop` on a dedicated terminal or SSH session to watch Python build process live.

    After `dietpi-software` has finished and the service starts the first time, please go through the following steps manually:

    - Run `htop` and wait until the CPU usage of the `homeassistant` processes goes down to nearly zero.
    - Run `systemctl restart home-assistant`
    - Run `htop` and wait until the CPU usage of the `homeassistant` processes goes down to nearly zero.
    - Open the HA web UI (see "Access to the web interface" tab). It will again install some Python modules on first access, which can again take a little while. Always check `htop` if you are unsure, which reveals any currently running Python/pip module install process.

    To activate the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS), follow this guide: <https://hacs.xyz/docs/configuration/basic/>

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The web interface is accessible via port **8123**:

    URL: `http://<your.IP>:8123`

=== "Configuration files"

    The configuration files are stored system-wide within:  
    `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/homeassistant`

    Please see the online documentation: <https://home-assistant.io/docs/>

=== "Customize Python environment"

    Home Assistant is installed within a dedicated Python environment, powered by: <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>.  
    This places a standalone Python instance which runs completely independent from any other installed Python instance or modules. If you need to install additional Python modules into this pyenv environment, update Python itself or similar, you need to open a shell as user `homeassistant` and activate the pyenv environment:

    ```sh
    sudo -u homeassistant bash
    . /home/homeassistant/pyenv-activate.sh
    pip3 install <module> # Or whichever install/update you need to do
    ```

=== "Known additional dependencies for device integration"

    IKEA TRÃ…DFRI: `apt install autoconf`

=== "View logs"

    To view Home Assistant logs, run the following command from console:

    ```sh
    journalctl -u home-assistant
    ```

=== "Update"

    To quickly update Home Assistant to the current version, run:

    ```sh
    /home/homeassistant/homeassistant-update.sh
    ```

    To update as well the whole `pyenv` Python version, reinstall Home Assistant:

    ```sh
    dietpi-software reinstall 157
    ```
