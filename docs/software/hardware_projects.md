## Google AIY

"Ok Google. Who is your daddy?"

???+ note "Our installation is highly optimized and lightweight"

    We do not install a desktop environment. User will be required to setup Google API and keys on another system (please see first run setup below).  
    We highly recommend SSH to allow for a quick setup of Google API and device link.  
    We also recommend one of [DietPi file servers](file_servers.md), for easy transfer of `assistant.json`, generated during Google API setup.

![Google AIY logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-googleaiy.jpg){: width="400" height="239" loading="lazy"}

=== "First run setup"

    Once DietPi has installed the Google AIY Voice Kit, and rebooted, you will need to setup your Google API account and link the device.

    - Follow the link below, to setup Google API and download client keys, required to enable the speech API:  
      <https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice#google-assistant--get-credentials>  
      Remark: When setting up the activity controls, ensure you also enable "Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services", else she will not function ;).
    - Make sure you have one of [DietPi's file servers](file_servers.md) installed.  
      Once completed, download the `client_secret.json` and save it to:
        - If using SSH: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/voice-recognizer-raspi/assistant.json`
        - If using file server: `voice-recognizer-raspi/assistant.json`
    - Run the command below, then follow the onscreen link/instructions to setup verification:

        ```sh
        cd /mnt/dietpi_userdata/voice-recognizer-raspi
        sudo -u dietpi env/bin/python3 -u src/main.py
        ```

    - Once the "Ok, Google" prompt appears, test the device. Then you can terminate the program with ++ctrl+c++ and restart the service:

      ```sh
      systemctl restart voice-recognizer
      ```

=== "Installation notes"

    The Voice Kit software is located at:

      ```
      /mnt/dietpi_userdata/voice-recognizer-raspi
      ```

=== "Check service status"

    To check the status of the service run:

    ```sh
    systemctl status voice-recognizer
    ```

    ![htop screenshot showing Google AIY Voice Kit service running](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-googleaiy-htop.png){: width="400" height="238" loading="lazy"}

## Mycroft AI

Mycroft AI is a free and open source voice assistant.

![Mycroft AI logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-mycroftai.png){: width="200" height="33" loading="lazy"}

=== "Interactive install"

    1. Branch selection: For inexperienced users we recommend the master branch as well: ++y++
    2. Auto updates: It slows down the the startup process a bit, but it anyway takes a while to load all skills, so we recommend this as well: ++y++
    3. Add Mycroft commands to PATH: Chose *NO* here, since the installer runs as user `mycroft`, which is no login user, which is why this has no effect: ++n++
    4. Check code before submitting: If you are an official Mycroft developer, choose ++y++, else: ++n++

=== "Initial setup"

    1. If you did no reboot after install, load Mycroft commands to current shell session: `. /etc/bashrc.d/mycroft.sh`
    2. Start CLI client: `mycroft-cli-client`
    3. You should see and at best hear the invitation to pair your device, e.g.: `PairingSkill - INFO - Pairing code: XXYYZZ`
    4. Visit <https://home.mycroft.ai/> to start pairing and configuring your device and skills.

=== "Build Mimic for offline TTS (British Male) support (optional)""

    Remark: this requires about 3 GiB of RAM and takes a while, so assure that you have enough memory (4 GiB recommended), in case increase your swap file size and grab yourself a coffee.

    ```sh
    cd /mnt/dietpi_userdata/mycroft-core
    sudo -u mycroft ./scripts/install-mimic.sh $(nproc)
    ```

## PiJuice

PiJuice is an all in one, battery based power supply HAT for the RPi, featuring UPS capabilities and battery run time.

![PiJuice logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-pijuice.jpg){: width="400" height="300" loading="lazy"}

=== "Basic information"

    Our default installation does not include the desktop application. If required, please install a desktop first, then execute the following command to install the GUI afterwards:

    ```sh
    apt install pijuice-gui
    ```

    The PiJuice program can then be launched (LXDE) from LXDE start \> Preferences

    - SW1 = Power on unit
    - SW2 = Power off unit (runs a sample script which can be modified `/var/lib/dietpi/dietpi-software/installed/pijuice/pijuice_func1.sh`)
    - Additional configuration can be made via editing the following file (Full list of available config options):

        ```sh
        nano /var/lib/pijuice/pijuice_config.JSON
        ```

    Restart the service to apply any changes:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart pijuice
    ```

=== "Update firmware"

    At the time of writing, this will update firmware on the device to `V1.1_2018_01_15`, however, please replace the firmware link with the latest version:

    ```sh
    wget https://github.com/PiSupply/PiJuice/raw/master/Firmware/PiJuice-V1.1_2018_01_15.elf.binary -O package.binary
    chmod +x package.binary
    pijuiceboot 14 package.binary
    ```

## Mosquitto

Eclipse Mosquitto™ is an open-source (EPL/EDL-licensed) message broker that implements the MQTT protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1.  
MQTT provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for IoT (Internet of Things) messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers like the Arduino.

![Mosquitto logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-mosquitto.png){: width="100" height="76" loading="lazy"}

=== "Client configuration"

    Mosquitto by default listens on network port **1883**. Clients need to authenticate with the following credentials:

    - Username: `mosquitto`
    - Password: `<your global password>` (default: `dietpi`)

=== "Server configuration"

    - Config directory: `/etc/mosquitto`
    - Config file: `/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`
    - Password file: `/etc/mosquitto/passwd`

    To change the default authentication password for the `mosquitto` user, run the following command:

    ```sh
    mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd mosquitto
    ```

    To create a new authentication user, run the following command:

    ```sh
    mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd <new_user_name>
    ```

    After changes have been done, you need to restart the service:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart mosquitto
    ```

    For further details, see the official documentation, linked below.

=== "View logs"

    To view Mosquitto server logs, run the following command:

    ```sh
    journalctl -u mosquitto
    ```

=== "Update to latest version"

    Mosquitto is installed via its official APT repository, hence the following commands can be used to update it to the latest version:

    ```sh
    apt update
    apt install mosquitto
    ```

## Blynk Server

Platform with iOS and Android apps to control Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi and similar microcontroller boards over the Internet, written in Java. This is the server component to replace the Blynk Inc. cloud servers.

Also installs:

- Blynk JS library: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/blynk-library>

![Blynk app on a smartphone](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-blynk.jpg){: width="375" height="400" loading="lazy"}

=== "Web interface"

    The web interface uses port **9443**:

    - URL: `https://<your.IP>:9443/admin` (You may ignore the browser warning, as a self-signed certificate is used by default.)
    - Email address: `admin@blynk.cc`
    - Password: `<your global password>` (default: `dietpi`)

=== "Setup details"

    DietPi installs Blynk (including user data and config file) to the following location:

    ```
    /mnt/dietpi_userdata/blynk
    ```

    Logs can be viewed via:

    ```sh
    journalctl -u blynkserver
    ```

    and more detailed log files in:

    ```
    /var/log/blynk
    ```

    We created a systemd service for Blynk, automatically started by DietPi at boot:

    ```sh
    systemctl status blynkserver
    ```

    DietPi will also install the ***Blynk JS library***, along with this installation. Please skip this section when you reach the Blynk user guide.

=== "Configuration"

    !!! warning "Config file changes via web UI do not have any effect."

    To change settings you need to edit

    ```
    /mnt/dietpi_userdata/blynk/server.properties
    ```

    and restart the Blynk server:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart blynkserver
    ```

=== "Getting started with Blynk app"

    !!! warning "The new "Blynk IoT" app does not support a self-hosted Blynk server!"

        The "legacy" Blynk app will prompt hints about the new "Blynk IoT" app at several places. You need to ignore these since the new app does not support self-hosted Blynk severs, but only the Blynk Inc. cloud.

    1. Download the Blynk app for Android: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.blynk>
    2. To log into your own server, press `Log In`, then the three dots at the bottom and switch the slider to `CUSTOM`.
    3. There you can enter your own Blynk server's IP/domain and use the above login credentials.
    4. Create a new project by following this guide: <https://docs.blynk.io/en/getting-started/what-do-i-need-to-blynk>
    5. The authentication token for the new project can be obtained from the app and as well from the web interface at `Users` > `admin@blynk.cc` within the `Profile DashBoards` section. Use it to connect with your Blynk library Node scripts.

=== "Run test script"

    Once you created a project in the iOS/Android app, you may test the connection via `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/blynk/client-tcp-local.js`. You need to edit the file and replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with the authentication token of your project. Then run it:

    ```sh
    /mnt/dietpi_userdata/blynk/client-tcp-local.js
    ```

    Within the script you can also define event listeners and handlers. By default the value of the virtual pin `V1` is printed to console when it changes, and the value of the virtual pin `V9` is set to system time seconds whenever the pin is read. For a more interactive test you could hence add the following widgets to your project via app:

    1. Add a `Button` and change its `OUTPUT` pin to `Virtual` > `V1`. Go back and hit the play button. Whenever you push the button in the app, the test script console should print the value changes as defined.
    2. Hit the stop button. Add a `Value Display`, change its `INPUT` pin to `Virtual` > `V9` and the `READING RATE` to `1 sec`. Go back and hit the start button. While the test script is running, the display widget will not show the server's system time seconds, updated every 1-2 seconds.

    Hit ++ctrl+c++ to exit the test script.

=== "Update"

    Update Blynk with:

    ```sh
    dietpi-software reinstall 131
    ```

## Audiophonics PI-SPC

Power control module for Raspberry Pi which allows you to physically power on/off the system, without the need to run `poweroff`.
See <https://www.audiophonics.fr/en/raspberry-pi-and-other-sbc-accessories/audiophonics-pi-spc-v2-power-management-module-for-raspberry-pi-p-10912.html> for further details.

![Audiophonics PCB photo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-audiophonis-pcb.jpg){: width="400" height="400" loading="lazy"}

???+ notes "Ensure correct GPIO pins!"

    Please ensure the correct GPIO pins are used, when connecting Pi-SPC to RPi (see image below).

    ![Raspberry Pi GPIO scheme](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-audiophonics-gpionumbers.png){: width="400" height="119" loading="lazy"}

To power off the system begin the shutdown process: Hold the power button for < 0.5 seconds. If you don't have a button, you can also close the pins `BP PIN C` and `BP PIN NO`, with your favorite electrically conductive metal (e.g.: tweezers).  
Remark: Avoid holding the power button for longer than 2 seconds, as this will hard power off the system (same effect as pulling the power cord). Doing so will create file-system corruptions, during shutdown IO operations.

## Grafana

The open platform for beautiful analytics and monitoring.

This installation and documentation was possible, thanks to [@marcobrianza](https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1784#issuecomment-390778313).  
Remark: Grafana binaries are specific to the CPU architecture, therefore, swapping SD cards between RPi 1 <> 2+, is not recommended.

![Grafana web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-grafana.png){: width="400" height="197" loading="lazy"}

=== "Prerequisites"

    A database server is required for Grafana. As Grafana offers many options (InfluxDB/MySQL), we have not automatically installed either as manual configuration may be preferred.  
    However, we highly recommend installing [InfluxDB](databases.md#influxdb).

    You can do this using the install steps provided by **DietPi-Software** tool or running the next command line in the terminal:

    ```sh  
    dietpi-software install 74
    ```

    After the InfluxDB is installed, please follow the database creation guide [here](databases.md#influxdb).

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The web interface is accessible via port **3001**:

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>:3001`
    - Username: `admin`
    - Password: `<your global password>` (default: `dietpi`)

=== "Usage information"

    If you have created a database as per the InfluxDB online documentation, please follow these instructions:

    - From the Home Dashboard click `Add data source`, then enter the following information:
        - Type = `InfluxDB`
        - URL = `http://localhost:8086`
        - Database = `mydb`
        - Username = `test_user`
        - Password = `test_password01`
        - Leave the remaining items with the default values.
    - Click `Save & Test`
    - From the Home Dashboard
        - click `New dashboard`
        - click `Graph`
        - click on the example graph
        - Press ++e++ to edit the Data Source and the custom query

=== "Installation information"

    The data location for Grafana is stored resp. linked with symbolic links to the DietPi userdata directory: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/grafana`
