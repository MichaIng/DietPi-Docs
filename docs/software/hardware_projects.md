## Google AIY

"Ok Google. Who is your daddy?"

???+ note "Our installation is highly optimized and lightweight"

    We do not install a desktop environment. User will be required to setup Google API and keys on another system (please see first run setup below).  
    We highly recommend SSH to allow for a quick setup of Google API and device link.  
    We also recommend one of [DietPi File servers](https://dietpi.com/docs/software/file_servers/), for easy transfer of `assistant.json`, generated during Google API setup.

![Google AIY logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-googleaiy.jpg){: width="400" height="239" loading="lazy"}

=== "First run setup"

    Once DietPi has installed the Google AIY voice kit, and rebooted, you will need to setup your Google API account and link the device.

    - Follow the link below, to setup Google API and download client keys, required to enable the speech API:  
      <https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice#users-guide-1-2--turn-on-the-google-assistant-api>  
      Remark: When setting up the activity controls, ensure you also enable "Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services", else she will not function ;)
    - Make sure you have one of [DietPi's File Servers](https://dietpi.com/docs/software/file_servers/) installed.  
      Once completed, download the `client_secret.json` and save it to:
        - If using SSH = `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/voice-recognizer-raspi/assistant.json`
        - If using File Server = `voice-recognizer-raspi/assistant.json`
    - Run the command below, then follow the onscreen link/instructions to setup verification:

        ```sh
        sudo -u dietpi /mnt/dietpi_userdata/voice-recognizer-raspi/env/bin/python3 -u /mnt/dietpi_userdata/voice-recognizer-raspi/src/main.py
        ```

    - Once the "Ok, Google" prompt appears, test the device. Then you can terminate the program with ++ctrl+c++ and restart the services:

      ```sh
      dietpi-services restart
      ```

=== "Installation notes"

    The voice software is located there:  
    `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/voice-recognizer-raspi`

=== "Check service status"

    To check the status of the service run:

    ```sh
    dietpi-services status
    ```

## Mycroft AI

Mycroft AI is a free and open source voice assistant.

![Mycroft AI logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-mycroftai.png){: width="200" height="33" loading="lazy"}

=== "Interactive install"

    1. Branch selection: For inexperienced users we recommend the master branch as well: ++y++
    2. Auto updates: It slows down the the startup process a bit, but it anyway takes a while to load all skills, so we recommend this as well: ++y++
    3. Add Mycroft commands to PATH: Chose *NO* here, since the installer runs as user `mycroft`, which is no login user, which is why this has no effect: ++n++
    4. Check code before submitting: If you are an official Mycroft developer, choose ++y++, else: ++n++

=== "Initial setup"

    1. If you did no reboot after install, load Mycroft commands to current shell session: `. /etc/bashrc.d/mycroft.sh`
    2. Start CLI client: `mycroft-cli-client`
    3. You should see and at best hear the invitation to pair your device, e.g.: `PairingSkill - INFO - Pairing code: XXYYZZ`
    4. Visit <https://home.mycroft.ai/> to start pairing and configuring your device and skills.

=== "Build Mimic for offline TTS (British Male) support (optional)""

    Remark: this requires about 3 GiB of RAM and takes a while, so assure that you have enough memory (4 GiB recommended), in case increase your swap file size and grab yourself a coffee.

    ```sh
    cd /mnt/dietpi_userdata/mycroft-core
    sudo -u mycroft ./scripts/install-mimic.sh $(nproc)
    ```

## PiJuice

PiJuice is an all in one, battery based power supply HAT for the RPi, featuring UPS capabilities and battery run time.

=== "Basic information"

    Our default installation does not include the desktop application. If required, please install a desktop first, then execute the following command to install the GUI afterwards:

    ```sh
    apt install pijuice-gui
    ```

    The PiJuice program can then be launched (LXDE) from LXDE start \> Preferences

    - SW1 = Power on unit
    - SW2 = Power off unit (runs a sample script which can be modified `/var/lib/dietpi/dietpi-software/installed/pijuice/pijuice_func1.sh`)
    - Additional configuration can be made via editing the following file (Full list of available config options):

        ```sh
        nano /var/lib/pijuice/pijuice_config.JSON
        ```

    Restart the service to apply any changes:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart pijuice
    ```

=== "Update firmware"

    At the time of writing, this will update firmware on the device to `V1.1_2018_01_15`, however, please replace the firmware link with the latest version:

    ```sh
    wget https://github.com/PiSupply/PiJuice/raw/master/Firmware/PiJuice-V1.1_2018_01_15.elf.binary -O package.binary

## Mosquitto

Eclipse Mosquitto™ is an open-source (EPL/EDL-licensed) message broker that implements the MQTT protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1.  
MQTT provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for IoT (Internet of Things) messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers like the Arduino.

![Mosquitto logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-mosquitto.png){: width="100" height="76" loading="lazy"}

=== "Client configuration"

    Mosquitto by default listens on network port **1883**. Clients need to authenticate with the following credentials:

    - Username: `mosquitto`
    - Password: `<your global password>` (default: `dietpi`)

=== "Server configuration"

    - Config directory: `/etc/mosquitto`
    - Config file: `/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`
    - Password file: `/etc/mosquitto/passwd`

    To change the default authentication password for the `dietpi` user, run the following command:

    ```sh
    mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd mosquitto
    ```

    To create a new authentication user, run the following command:

    ```sh
    mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd
    ```

    After changes have been done, you need to restart the service:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart mosquitto
    ```

    For further details, see the official documentation, linked below.

## Blynk Server

Platform with iOS and Android apps to control Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi and similar microcontroller boards over the Internet.

Also installs:

- Blynk JS Library

![Blynk app on a smartphone](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-blynk.jpg){: width="375" height="400" loading="lazy"}

=== "Installation notes"

    DietPi installs Blynk (including user data and config file) to the following location:  
    `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/blynk`

    Log files can be found in:  
    `/var/log/blynk`

    We created a `systemd` service for Blynk, DietPi will automatically start this:

    ```sh
    systemctl status blynkserver
    ```

    DietPi will also install ***Blynk JS Library***, along with this installation. Please skip this section when you reach the Blynk user guide.

=== "Access to the web admin interface"

    The web interface uses port **9443**:

    - URL = `https://<your.IP>:9443/admin`
    - Default user: `admin@blynk.cc`
    - Default password: `admin`

    These values can be adjusted by editing the config file below.

=== "Server configuration"

    Remark: The config file changes in the web UI do not have an effect yet: <https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server/issues/1318>

    To change settings you need to edit  
    `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/blynk/server.properties`  
    and restart the Blynk server:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart blynkserver
    ```

=== "Getting started with Blynk app"

    To log into your own server, press `Log In`, then the three dots at the bottom and switch the slider to `CUSTOM`. There you can enter your own Blynk servers IP/domain and use the above login credentials.

    You can then skip creating an external Blynk account and instead go on and create a new project directly: <https://docs.blynk.cc/#getting-started-getting-started-with-the-blynk-app-2-create-a-new-project>

=== "Run test script"

    Once you create a project in the iOS/Android app, run the command:

    ```sh
    blynk-client <replace_with_your_auth_code>
    ```

=== "Update to the latest version"

    Update Blynk with: `dietpi-software reinstall 131`.

## Audiophonics PI-SPC

Power control module for Raspberry Pi which allows you to physically power on/off the system, without the need to run `poweroff`.
See <https://www.audiophonics.fr/fr/kits-et-modules-diy/audiophonics-pi-spc-v2-module-de-controle-alimentation-type-atx-pre-assemble-p-11125.html> for further details.

![Audiophonics PCB photo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-audiophonis-pcb.jpg){: width="400" height="400" loading="lazy"}

???+ notes "Ensure correct GPIO pins!"

    Please ensure the correct GPIO pins are used, when connecting Pi-SPC to RPi (see image below).

    ![Raspberry Pi GPIO scheme](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-audiophonics-gpionumbers.png){: width="400" height="119" loading="lazy"}

To power off the system begin the shutdown process: Hold the power button for < 0.5 seconds. If you don't have a button, you can also close the pins `BP PIN C` and `BP PIN NO`, with your favorite electrically conductive metal (e.g.: tweezers).  
Remark: Avoid holding the power button for longer than 2 seconds, as this will hard power off the system (same effect as pulling the power cord). Doing so will create file-system corruptions, during shutdown IO operations.

## InfluxDB

InfluxDB is a database optimized to save time based data as logs or data from a sensor.  
The main interface to the database for management and data transferred are HTTP requests that are handled directly by the `influxdb` service (default port being used is 8086).

The data can be nicely viewed with Grafana.  
This installation and documentation was possible, thanks to [@marcobrianza](https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1784#issuecomment-390778313).

![InfluxDB logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-webstack-influxdb.svg){: width="300" height="112" loading="lazy"}

### Usage

The package comes with a command line tool `influx` for database management operations.  
This tool also uses HTTP so it can manage a database on a remote machine setting the -host option.

#### Create a database

To create a database execute:

```sh
influx -execute 'create database mydb'
```

Alternative method:

```sh
curl -i -XPOST http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode "q=CREATE DATABASE mydb"
```

#### Posting data

Data can be posted by executing:

```sh
curl -i -XPOST 'http://localhost:8086/write?db=mydb' --data-binary 'temperature value=20.12'
```

#### Show data

```sh
influx -database mydb -execute 'SELECT * FROM temperature'
```

Alternative method:

```sh
curl -i -XPOST http://localhost:8086/query?db=mydb --data-urlencode "q=SELECT * FROM temperature"
```

#### Authentication

By default HTTP authentication is disabled. To enable it, change `auth-enabled = true` in the configuration file `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`. Then restart services with `dietpi-services restart`.

#### Create users and authorizations from `influx` CLI

To start the InfluxDB database management interface enter:

```sh
influx -username admin -password admin01
```

Then create the database entries:

```sh
CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'admin01' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
CREATE USER test_user WITH PASSWORD 'test_user01'
GRANT ALL ON mydb TO test_user
exit
```

### Install information

The data location for InfluxDB is stored resp. linked with symbolic links to the DietPi userdata directory: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/influxdb`

***

Official documentation: <https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb>

## Grafana

The open platform for beautiful analytics and monitoring.

This installation and documentation was possible, thanks to [@marcobrianza](https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1784#issuecomment-390778313).  
Remark: Grafana binaries are specific to the CPU architecture, therefore, swapping SD cards between RPi 1 <> 2+, is not recommended.

![Grafana web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-hardwareprojects-grafana.png){: width="400" height="197" loading="lazy"}

=== "Prerequisites"

    A database server is required for Grafana. As Grafana offers many options (InfluxDB/MySQL), we have not automatically installed either as manual configuration may be preferred.  
    However, we highly recommend installing [InfluxDB](../databases/#influxdb).

    You can do this using the install steps provided by **DietPi-Software** tool or running the next command line in the terminal:
    
    ```sh  
    dietpi-software install 74
    ```

    After the InfluxDB is installed, please follow the database creation guide [here](../databases/#influxdb).

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The web interface is accessible via port **3001**:

    - URL = `http://<your.IP>:3001`
    - Username = `admin`
    - Password = `<your global password>`

=== "Usage information"

    If you have created a database as per the InfluxDB online documentation, please follow these instructions:

    - From the Home Dashboard click `Add data source`, then enter the following information:
        - Type = `InfluxDB`
        - URL = `http://localhost:8086`
        - Database = `mydb`
        - Username = `test_user`
        - Password = `test_password01`
        - Leave the remaining items with the default values.
    - Click `Save & Test`
    - From the Home Dashboard
        - click `New dashboard`
        - click `Graph`
        - click on the example graph
        - Press ++e++ to edit the Data Source and the custom query

=== "Installation information"

    The data location for Grafana is stored resp. linked with symbolic links to the DietPi userdata directory: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/grafana`
