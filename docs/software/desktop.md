## Desktop utilities

### Chromium - Web browser

#### Does my device support GPU acceleration?

Not all devices support GPU acceleration with Chromium.
- RPis supports native OpenGL and will be configured during installation.
- Odroids support OpenGLES and will be configured during installation.
- Other devices will most likely be limited to software rendering.

#### Where can I check the status of GPU acceleration?

Once Chromium is running, simply go to the following address: <chrome://gpu>

#### Enable support for Widevine DRM protected content on RPi
