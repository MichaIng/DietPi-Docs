## LXDE

LXDE is highly optimised and ultra lightweight desktop. It works well with computers on the low end of the performance spectrum such as new generation netbooks and small computers, or older resource-constrained machines.

## LXQt

Optimised lightweight desktop without the bloatware. Slick and fluid GUI, however, more resource heavy than LXDE.

## Desktop utilities

### Chromium

![Chromium screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-desktop-tools-chromium.jpg){: width="1376" height="858" loading="lazy"}

=== "Chromium kiosk mode"

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    The **Chromium kiosk mode** is a Chromium feature that allows your device to be used in a single-window resp. single-app kiosk mode. Generally, any access to the rest of your system is locked.  
    The mode can be used to set the web browser to these properties:

    - Full screen
    - No menu bar, no toolbar, no address field,...
    - No option to exit the browser resp. change the tabs

    Two examples using the mode are to use your system

    - as a display of only one or several web pages (via tabs) without access to the whole system
    - as a browser based smart home GUI

    The kiosk mode can be distinguished to the **Single App Kiosk Mode**, where the user is locked into one single particular site having a fullscreen mode that can't be changed or exited.  
    Following is an example of a kiosk mode screenshot for the example site `dietpi.com`:

    ![Chromium kiosk mode screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-desktop-chromium-kiosk-mode.jpg){: width="360" height="208" loading="lazy"}

    <h4>Activate Chromium kiosk mode</h4>

    To put your Chromium browser into kiosk mode the following steps have to be achieved:

    1. Install Chromium browser via 

        ```sh
        dietpi-software install 113
        ```

        If Chromium is not installed, you will get a startup error message that the file `/var/lib/dietpi/dietpi-software/installed/chromium-autostart.sh` is not found if you activate Chromium kiosk mode via `dietpi-autostart`.

    1. Select Chromium kiosk mode (with automatic login) via

        ```sh
        dietpi-autostart
        ```

        and select `11 : Chromium - Dedicated use without desktop` in the main dialog.  
        In the following dialog enter the autostart web page which shall be displayed initially.

    1. Reboot to the Chromium kiosk mode

    <h4>Deactivate Chromium kiosk mode</h4>

    To deactivate the kiosk mode, e.g. login to the system via ssh and execute `dietpi-autostart` to switch away from the kiosk mode.

    <h4>Tweak kiosk mode behaviour</h4>

    The kiosk mode behaviour is defined by the contents of the file  
    `/var/lib/dietpi/dietpi-software/installed/chromium-autostart.sh`  
    which can be tweaked by editing it.

    There are some hints how to achieve tweaking:

### Firefox

Firefox Browser, also known as simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.

Similar to [Chromium](#chromium), Firefox has been made a separate install option. For desktop installs users can choose between Chromium, Firefox or no web browser.
