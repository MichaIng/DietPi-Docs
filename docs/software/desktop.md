## LXDE

LXDE is highly optimised and ultra lightweight desktop. It works well with computers on the low end of the performance spectrum such as new generation netbooks and small computers, or older resource-constrained machines.

## Desktop utilities

### Chromium

#### Does my device support GPU acceleration?

Not all devices support GPU acceleration with Chromium.

- RPis supports native OpenGL and will be configured during installation.
- Odroids support OpenGLES and will be configured during installation.
- Other devices will most likely be limited to software rendering.

#### Where can I check the status of GPU acceleration?

Once Chromium is running, simply go to the following address: `chrome://gpu`

#### Enable support for Widevine DRM protected content on RPi

### Firefox

![Firefox logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-firefox.png){: width="128" height="128" loading="lazy"}

Firefox Browser, also known as simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.

Similar to [Chromium](#chromium), Firefox has been made a separate install option. For desktop installs users can choose between Chromium, Firefox or no web browser.

### GIMP

MS Paint on steroids. If you need to edit pixels with a vast number of tools, GIMP is the only program you'll need.

### Xfce Power Manager

Enables laptop users to set up a power profile for two different modes `on battery power` and `on AC Power` while still allowing desktop users to at least change the DPMS settings and CPU frequency using the settings dialogue.
