    To add/change the valid user do the following steps:

    - Edit /etc/samba/smb.conf

        - Add the user to Samba with `smbpasswd -a username_i_require`
    - Restart services with `systemctl restart nmbd smbd`

    You can now connect to the samba server with the username and password you entered above.
