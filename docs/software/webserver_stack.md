## Overview

If you are you looking for an inexpensive way to operate your web servers or a dynamic websites, you could choose one of the web development stacks. They come with a complete package. Not only will you have the DietPi OS, web server, but you'll have the database software, and also the scripting language.

All stacks come with PHP caches (APCu and OPcache). The sizes of which are optimized based on a share of total memory.

## LAMP web stack

LAMP stack is a popular open source web platform commonly used to run dynamic web sites and servers. It is considered by many, as the platform of choice for development and deployment of high performance web applications which require a solid and reliable foundation.

=== "Quick start"

    **Access website:**

    - URL = http://192.168.0.100 (`http://<your.local.ip>` or `http://<your.host.name>`)
    - local directory = /var/www

    **Access phpinfo:**

    - URL = http://192.168.0.100/phpinfo.php

    **Access memory cache info:**

    - APCu = http://192.168.0.100/apc.php
    - OPcache = http://192.168.0.100/opcache.php

    **MariaDB Details:**

    - username = root
    - password = dietpi

=== "Secured access - HTTPS/SSL"

    **Let's Encrypt** is highly recommended - [see here how to install](../../dietpi_tools/#lets-encrypt-ssl-nordvpn-support). This will automate the creation and setup of your free SSL cert.

    ??? note "Alternative way: Manually enable HTTP/SSL by installing a self-signed SSL certificate"

        !!! caution ""
            This method is recommended only in case **Let's encrypt** is not a viable option.

        **Step 1. Create key**

        ``` bash
        mkdir -p /etc/apache2/ssl
        openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1000 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key -out /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
        ```

        **Step 2. Enable SSL config and restart Apache**

        ``` bash
        chmod 600 /etc/apache2/ssl/*
        cat << _EOF_ > /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf

        <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
            <VirtualHost _default_:443>
                    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
                    ServerName example.com:443
                    DocumentRoot /var/www

                    LogLevel error
                    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
                    #CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

                    SSLEngine on

                    SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
                    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key

                    <FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$">
                                    SSLOptions +StdEnvVars

                    <Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin>
                                    SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
                    </Directory>
                </VirtualHost>
            </IfModule>
        '_EOF_'

        a2enmod ssl
        service apache2 restart
        ```

    Access website:

    - URL = **https**://192.168.0.100 (`https://<your.local.ip>` or `https://<your.host.name>`)

=== "Individual installation"

    The web development stack could be also individually installed. This option offers more flexibility giving the opportunity to select:

    - **Webserver**

        Depending on your needs, you may choose the web server that fits best your needs. In case **Apache2** is not the right choice, you could continue with **Lighttpd** which comes automatically installed with DietPi, **Nginx** or **Tomcat**.

    - Database

        You may choose to install **MariaDB** or other available databases like **InfluxDB**, **Redis**, **SQLite**.

=== "Official documentation"

    - Apache HTTP Web Server - [http://httpd.apache.org](http://httpd.apache.org)
    - MariaDB Server - [https://mariadb.org](https://mariadb.org)
    - PHP - [https://www.php.net](https://www.php.net)

## LASP web stack

LASP is a variation of the popular open source [LAMP web stack](#lamp-web-stack), providing SQLite instead of MariaDB. 

SQLite is an embedded relational database engine. The documentation calls it _a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration and transactional SQL database engine_. It is very popular and there are hundreds of millions copies worldwide in use today. Together with Apache2 and PHP could be a good candidate for single board computer.
