## Stacks for Web Development

DietPi offers an **one-click-installation** of the following web development stacks:

- [**LAMP** web stack - **Apache2 / MariaDB / PHP**](#lamp-web-stack)
- [**LASP** web stack - **Apache2 / SQLite / PHP**](#lasp-web-stack)
- [**LEMP** web stack - **Nginx / MariaDB / PHP**](#lemp-web-stack)
- [**LESP** web stack - **Nginx / SQLite / PHP**](#lesp-web-stack)  
- [**LLMP** web stack - **Lighttpd / MariaDB / PHP**](#llmp-web-stack)
- [**LLSP** web stack - **Lighttpd / SQLite / PHP**](#llsp-web-stack)

!!! hint "Meaning of the acronyms *LAMP*, *LASP*, *LEMP*, *LESP*, *LLMP*, *LLSP*"

    - OS: **L** for Linux
    - Webserver: **A** for Apache2, **E** for Nginx, **L** for Lighttpd
    - Database: **M** for MariaDB, **S** for SQLite
    - Scripting language: **P** for PHP

!!! hint ""
    All stacks come with **PHP caches** (APCu and OPcache), being optimized based on a share of the total memory.

### Which Web Application Stack is best for you ?

=== "Which WEBSERVER to CHOOSE ?"

    **Apache2**

    - Memory use = **High** | Multithreaded = **Yes**

    Apache2 is feature-rich and popular. It is recommended for beginners and users who are looking to follow Apache2 based guides.

    **Nginx**

    - Memory use = **Medium** | Multithreaded = **Yes**

    Nginx is a lightweight alternative to Apache2. Nginx claims faster webserver performance compared to Apache2. Ideal for medium-high traffic situations where Lighttpd will suffer.

    **Lighttpd**

    - Memory use = **Low** | Multithreaded = **Optional** - Some drawbacks

    Lighttpd is extremely lightweight and is generally considered to offer the "best" webserver performance on Linux for SBCs (single board computers). It is recommended for users who expect low webserver traffic and/or personal use.  
    Although the DietPi installation of Lighttpd is set to single threaded, do not be put off by this, in low usage scenarios (<10 users) it will still outperform Nginx and Apache2. Activation of multithreading is described in the Lighttpd package description.

    **Further reading & benchmarks**

    See <https://detechter.com/the-battle-of-the-web-servers-apache-vs-Nginx-vs-lighttpd-2/>.

=== "Which DATABASE to CHOOSE ?"

    **MariaDB**  
    MariaDB is an open source RDBMS (relational data base management system). It is application compatible to MySQL, i.e. it can be used as a *drop in* replacement for MySQL. It has more features, fewer bugs, and a better performance compared to MySQL.

    **SQLite**  
    SQLite is an RDBMS, also compatible to MySQL. It offers a broader language support (i.e. more bindings to programming languages) compared to MariaDB. SQLite has a very small footprint. As drawbacks, it has no multi user capabilities and a couple of SQL features are missing.

### How to install ?

DietPi contains the option to choose the web stack of your favourite. Basically choosing the web stack resp. webserver, you have two options within `dietpi-software`:

- Selection via ***Software Optimized*** or
- Selection via ***Webserver Preference***

The latter is used only in the case of the first webserver background installation.

=== "Selection via Software Optimized"

    ![DietPi webserver selection software optimized](../assets/images/dietpi-software-webstack-selection.png)

    Using this option you select the complete web stack for installation. Just select the web stack you want to install and do the installation via the *Install* execution within `dietpi-software`.

    !!! hint ""
        Unless you _specifically_ need a web stack, it is recommended that you allow DietPi to install the default web stack automatically. This ensures compatibility and stability of your system.

=== "Selection via Webserver Preference"

    ![DietPi webserver selection webserver preference](../assets/images/dietpi-software-webserver-preference.png){: style="width:500px"}

    Using this option you only select the webserver for use in DietPi installations.  
    When you select any software for installation that requires a webserver (e.g. Pi-hole, Nextcloud, Webmin, installed via *Software Optimized*), DietPi will automatically install, configure and optimize your chosen webserver preference. DietPi will also install [MySQL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)/[SQLite](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) as required, depending on your software selections. Basically, you will never need to manually select/install a webserver stack again. DietPi will do it all for you.

    ???+ info "No webserver change if already installed"
        This setting "Webserver Preference* can NOT be changed if an existing webserver is installed on the system.

### LAMP Web Stack

LAMP stack is a popular open source web platform commonly used to run dynamic web sites and servers. It is considered by many, as the platform of choice for development and deployment of high performance web applications which require a solid and reliable foundation.

![dietpi-webstack-lamp](../assets/images/dietpi-software-webstack-lamp.jpg)

=== "Quick start"

    **Access website:**

    - URL = http://192.168.0.100 (`http://<your.local.ip>` or `http://<your.host.name>`)
    - local directory = /var/www

    **Access phpinfo:**

    - URL = http://192.168.0.100/phpinfo.php

    **Access memory cache info:**

    - APCu = http://192.168.0.100/apc.php
    - OPcache = http://192.168.0.100/opcache.php

    **MariaDB Details:**

    - username = root
    - password = dietpi

=== "Secured access - HTTPS/SSL"

    **Let's Encrypt** is highly recommended - [see here how to install](../../dietpi_tools/#lets-encrypt-ssl-nordvpn-support). This will automate the creation and setup of your free SSL cert.

    ??? note "Alternative way: Manually enable HTTP/SSL by installing a self-signed SSL certificate"

        !!! caution ""
            This method is recommended only in case **Let's encrypt** is not a viable option.

        **Step 1. Create key**

        ``` bash
        mkdir -p /etc/apache2/ssl
        openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1000 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key -out /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
        ```

        **Step 2. Enable SSL config and restart Apache**

        ```sh
        chmod 600 /etc/apache2/ssl/*
        cat << _EOF_ > /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf

        <IfModule mod_ssl.c>

## WebServers

### Apache2

Apache is open source and it is the most commonly used Web server on Linux systems.

Web servers are used to serve Web pages requested by client computers. Clients typically request and view Web pages using Web browser applications such as Firefox, Opera, Chromium, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer etc.

Apache is a Apache Software Foundation project. The goal is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.

### Nginx

**nginx** [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server. It was released in 2004 to address the problem of increased web traffic. It has earned an excellent reputation and it is used in top million busiest sites - some of the success stories are: Dropbox, Netflix, Wordpress.com, FastMail.FM.[^1]

The innovation of Nginx compared to earlier servers such as Apache was to use an asynchronous, event-driven architecture. Nginx is blazing fast, being extremely efficient when it comes to hardware utilization, allowing servers to get more speed out of their limited CPU and RAM. As a result, it is one of the fastest web server options for serving static content.

### Lighttpd

**Lighttpd** is a web server for UNIX/Linux and Windows operating systems. It is an alternative to Apache web server. It is also called Lighty.

It is designed to be secure, fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-critical environments. Its low memory footprint compared to other web servers, light CPU load and its speed goals make Lighttpd a perfect candidate for SBCs.

### Tomcat

What is **Apache Tomcat**? Essentially itâ€™s an open-source Java servlet and Java Server Page container that lets developers implement an array of enterprise Java applications. Tomcat also runs a HTTP web server environment in which Java code can run.

## Databases & Data stores
