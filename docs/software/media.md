## Squeezelite

![DietPi media server software Logitech Media Server](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-squeezebox.png){: style="width:500px"}

=== "Access to the web interface"

    - URL = `http://<your.IP>:9000`

=== "Transfer/add music"

    Make sure you have one of DietPi's [File Servers](https://dietpi.com/docs/software/file_servers/) installed.  
    Folders used by Mopidy:

    - folder = `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/Music`  

=== "Change Squeezelite command line options"

    - Run `dietpi-services`
    - Select `squeezelite`
    - Select `Edit`
    - Unset and re-set the `ExecStart` entry:
      :
      ```sh

      ```

      : The first `ExecStart=` is required to replace the existing `ExecStart` entry instead of adding a second one.

    - Save changes with `CTRL+o` and exit `dietpi-services`

## Shairport Sync

Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player which plays audio streamed from iTunes, iOS devices and third-party AirPlay sources such as ForkedDaapd and Airfoil.  
Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the source and hence with similar devices playing the same source. This allows for synchronised multi-room audio on multiple devices.

![DietPi media server software Shairport Sync](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-shairportsync.png){: style="width:400px"}

=== "AirPlay device name"

    When searching for an Airplay device, execute `shairport-sync` on DietPi.

=== "Stream from Android and iPad/iPhone"

    There are many AirPlay players available for Android (e.g. [AirPlay For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.screen.mirroring.airplay.streamtotv&hl=de)) and iPad/iPhone (e.g. [AirPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204289)).  
    Download and use the player of your choice.

=== "Stream from a Windows/Mac PC"

    Airfoil is an application that will let you stream audio playback directly to any Shairport Sync device. Press play on your favourite music player (e.g.: Winamp/Spotify) and click the speaker next to the DietPi device.

=== "Audiophiles - Master music in real time"

    By using a PC + Airfoil, you can master the music in real time using the PCs CPU. This will allow all your Shairport Sync devices to sound even better without any performance hit on the device.  
    FuzonMp3 is a lightweight music player coded in C++ that sounds "as it should" and supports VST plugins. iZotope Ozone 5 is highly recommended for audiophiles.

=== "Multiple Shairport devices / Change Shairport Sync name"

    If you are planning to use multiple Shairport devices on the same network, please make sure the hostname of each device is unique. The hostname will also effect the `shairport-sync` name.  
    This can be completed in `dietpi-config` \> `Security Options` \> `Change Hostname`.

=== "Soxr interpolation"

    Soxr interpolation will improve the output audio quality on Shairport. However, it is extremely CPU intensive.  
    Enable Soxr:

    ```sh
    sed -i '/interpolation = /c\interpolation = "soxr";' /usr/local/etc/shairport-sync.conf
    systemctl restart shairport-sync
    ```

    Disable Soxr:

    ```sh
    sed -i '/interpolation = /c\\/\/interpolation = "soxr";' /usr/local/etc/shairport-sync.conf
    systemctl restart shairport-sync
    ```

    If you have choppy playback using Soxr:  
    Increasing the `shairplay-sync` process priority (nice) may resolve the issue.

    - Run `dietpi-services` from the terminal
    - Select `shairport-sync` via up/down buttons then press `Enter`
    - Select `CPU Nice` via up/down buttons then press `Enter`
    - Select `-20 : (Highest priority)` via up button, then press `Enter`

    DietPi will then automatically apply and set the nice level.

    If the choppy playback continues, the CPU most likely is insufficient for the processing required for Soxr. Then Soxr should be disabled.

## ReadyMedia

Stream your shared media to any DLNA/UPnP capable device.

![DietPi media server software ReadyMedia](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-readymedia.jpg){: style="width:200px"}

=== "Access to ReadyMedia status"

    - URL = `http://<your.IP>:8200`

=== "Transfer media files to ReadyMedia"

    Make sure you have one of DietPi's [File Servers](https://dietpi.com/docs/software/file_servers/) installed.  
    Folders used by ReadyMedia:

    - `/Music`
    - `/Pictures`
    - `/Video`

=== "Refresh the ReadyMedia database"

    The database can be refreshed with this command:

    ```sh
    rm -r /mnt/dietpi_userdata/.MiniDLNA_Cache/* && systemctl restart minidlna
    ```

    <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/310#issuecomment-216262850>  
    SBCs should be fine for Music only.  
    A Virtual Machine is highly recommended for Video transcoding:  
    <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/310#issuecomment-219067830>

=== "Installation notes"

    DietPi will attempt to detect mic input during installation, and apply to DarkIce. If a microphone was not available, or you experience issue, check available microphones with: `arecord -l`

    - Then edit the device entry in `/etc/darkice.cfg`, or  
    - Simple copy and paste:

        ```sh
        sed -i "/^device[[:blank:]]/c\device = hw:$(arecord -l | mawk -F'[ :]' '/card/{print $2;exit}'),0" /etc/darkice.cfg
        ```

    - Restart services: `dietpi-services restart`

    We created a `systemd` service for DarkIce, DietPi will automatically start it. You can check its status by running the following command:

    ```sh
    systemctl -l status darkice
