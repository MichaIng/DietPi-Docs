## Shairport Sync

Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player which plays audio streamed from iTunes, iOS devices and third-party AirPlay sources such as ForkedDaapd and Airfoil.  
Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the source and hence with similar devices playing the same source. This allows for synchronised multi-room audio on multiple devices.

![Shairport Sync connection scheme](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-shairportsync.png){: width="400" height="233" loading="lazy"}

=== "AirPlay device name"

    When searching for an Airplay device, execute `shairport-sync` on DietPi.

=== "Stream from Android and iPad/iPhone"

    There are many AirPlay players available for Android (e.g. [AirPlay For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.screen.mirroring.airplay.streamtotv&hl=de)) and iPad/iPhone (e.g. [AirPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204289)).  
    Download and use the player of your choice.

=== "Stream from a Windows/Mac PC"

    Airfoil is an application that will let you stream audio playback directly to any Shairport Sync device. Press play on your favourite music player (e.g.: Winamp/Spotify) and click the speaker next to the DietPi device.

=== "Audiophiles - Master music in real time"

    By using a PC + [Airfoil](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/), you can master the music in real time using the PCs CPU. This will allow all your Shairport Sync devices to sound even better without any performance hit on the device.

=== "Multiple Shairport devices / Change Shairport Sync name"

    If you are planning to use multiple Shairport devices on the same network, please make sure the hostname of each device is unique. The hostname will also effect the `shairport-sync` name.  
    This can be completed in `dietpi-config` \> `Security Options` \> `Change Hostname`.

=== "Soxr interpolation"

    Soxr interpolation will improve the output audio quality on Shairport. However, it is extremely CPU intensive.  
    Enable Soxr:

    ```sh
    sed -i '/interpolation = /c\interpolation = "soxr";' /usr/local/etc/shairport-sync.conf
    systemctl restart shairport-sync
    ```

    Disable Soxr:

    ```sh
    sed -i '/interpolation = /c\\/\/interpolation = "soxr";' /usr/local/etc/shairport-sync.conf
    systemctl restart shairport-sync
    ```

    If you have choppy playback using Soxr:  
    Increasing the `shairplay-sync` process priority (nice) may resolve the issue.

    - Run `dietpi-services` from the terminal
    - Select `shairport-sync` via up/down buttons then press ++enter++
    - Select `CPU Nice` via up/down buttons then press ++enter++
    - Select `-20 : (Highest priority)` via up button, then press ++enter++

    DietPi will then automatically apply and set the nice level.

    If the choppy playback continues, the CPU most likely is insufficient for the processing required for Soxr. Then Soxr should be disabled.

## ReadyMedia

Stream your shared media to any DLNA/UPnP capable device.

![ReadyMedia logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-readymedia.jpg){: width="351" height="341" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access to ReadyMedia status"

    The web interface is accessible via port **8200**:

    - URL = `http://<your.IP>:8200`

![Roon Server usage scheme](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-roonserver.png){: width="400" height="134" loading="lazy"}

=== "Install a Roon Remote on another system"

    You can use the Roon Remote apps to control and configure the Roon Server:  
    <https://roonlabs.com/downloads.html>

=== "Recommended Music Storage Directory"

    When configuring your Roon Server, we highly recommend using the DietPi user data directory. This will allow you to transfer music over the network easily (see Transfer Music below), and storing the music on your Roon Server system:  
    `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/Music`

=== "Transfer media files to your device"

    Make sure you have one of DietPi's [File Servers](../file_servers/) installed.  
    Folders used by Roon Server:

    - Music folder = `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/Music`
    - Accessed from file server = `/Music`

## Roon Extension Manager

At startup the Roon Extension Manager accesses a repository containing the community developed extensions. Via `Settings` \> `Extensions` within Roon the repository can be viewed and an extension can be selected to perform a certain action.

![IceCast web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-icecast.png){: width="400" height="218" loading="lazy"}

=== "Installation notes"

    DietPi will attempt to detect mic input during installation, and apply to DarkIce. If a microphone was not available, or you experience issues, check available microphones with:

    ```sh
    arecord -l
    ```

    - Then edit the device entry in `/etc/darkice.cfg`, or  
    - Simply copy and paste:

        ```sh
        sed -i "/^device[[:blank:]]/c\device = hw:$(arecord -l | mawk -F'[ :]' '/card/{print $2;exit}'),0" /etc/darkice.cfg
        ```

    - Restart the DarkIce service:

        ```sh
        systemctl restart darkice
        ```

    We create `systemd` services for both, IceCast and DarkIce, automatically started by DietPi. You can check their status by running the following command:

    ```sh
    systemctl status icecast2
    systemctl status darkice
    ```

## Snapcast Server

A FOSS multi room audio solution - this part is the server app it sends music to one or more clients to play.

![Snapcast logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-snapcast.png){: width="300" height="48" loading="lazy"}

The Snapcast server needs to have its audio sources manually configured after installation. See the Snapcast documents for more details: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast#server>

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The Snapcast server provides a web interface on port **1740**, which allows you to control volumes for all clients and optionally play audio through your browser:

    - URL = `http://<your.IP>:1740`

=== "Implementation details"

    DietPi-Software installs the Snapcast server nearly with default configs, as shipped with the official package. Only the JSON RPC, which listens by default on port **1705**, is disabled. To enable and configure it, check the `[tcp]` section of the config file (see "Changing options" tab).

=== "Changing options"

    - `/etc/snapserver.conf`

    Then restart services with:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart snapserver
    ```

=== "Using MPD as an input source"

    If you have MPD installed you can use it as an input source.

    First you need to ensure that MPD outputs to a pipe you can do this in two ways.
    1) Install CAVA from the DietPi software list.  
    OR  
    2) Add the following to `/etc/mpd.conf` and restart with `systemctl restart mpd`

    ```
    audio_output {
        type "fifo"
        enabled "yes"
        name "snapcast"
        path "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
        format "48000:16:2"
    }
    ```

    Once you have done that you then need to add the following to `/etc/snapserver.conf` under `[stream]`. The `name` is the name as it will appear to Snapcast clients here I have called it `myMPD`. Check the Snapcast server docs for additional parameters you can pass in: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#pipe>

    ```
    source = pipe:///tmp/mpd.fifo?name=myMPD&mode=read
    ```

=== "Using Mopidy as an input source"

    If you have Mopidy installed you can use it as an input source.

    First you need to ensure that Mopidy outputs to a pipe. Add the following to `/etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf` and restart with `systemctl restart mopidy`

    ```
    [audio]
    output = audioresample ! audioconvert ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2,format=S16LE ! wavenc ! filesink location=/tmp/mopidy.fifo
    ```

    Once you have done that you then need to add the following to `/etc/snapserver.conf` under `[stream]`. The `name` is the name as it will appear to Snapcast clients here I have called it `myMopidy`. Check the Snapcast server docs for additional parameters you can pass in: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#pipe>

    ```
    source = pipe:///tmp/mopidy.fifo?name=myMopidy&mode=read
    ```

=== "Using Raspotify/librespot as an input source"

    If you have Raspotify installed you can use it as an input source.

    Add the following config under `[stream]`. The `name` is the name as it will appear to Snapcast clients here I have called it `mySpotify`. The `devicename` is the name that will be shown when connecting in Spotify. Check the Snapcast server docs for additional parameters you can pass in: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#librespot>. I have disabled the audio cache to protect the SD card.

    ```
    source = librespot:///usr/bin/librespot?name=mySpotify&devicename=SnapcastSpotify&disable_audio_cache=true
    ```

=== "Using AirPlay (Shairport Sync) as an input"

    First install `shairport-sync`.

    Then (at the moment - see: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4470>) we need to replace the Shairport Sync binary with one that supports `stdout`. To do this we need to compile a new binary - you will find details here:  
    <https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync/blob/master/INSTALL.md#build-and-install>

    You need to use this line when configuring instead of the line from the docs:

    ```sh
    ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --with-alsa --with-soxr --with-avahi --with-ssl=openssl --with-systemd --with-metadata --with-stdout
    ```

    Don't forget to run `make` and `make install`.

    Then add the following config under `[stream]`. The `name` is the name as it will appear to Snapcast clients here I have called it `myAirport`. The `devicename` is the name that will be shown when searching for Airport devices. Check the Snapcast server docs for additional parameters you can pass in: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#airplay>

    ```
    source = airplay:///usr/local/bin/shairport-sync?name=myAirport&devicename=SnapcastAirport&params=--configfile=/usr/local/etc/shairport-sync.conf
    ```

    You will then either need to mask the original Shairport Sync service

    ```sh
    systemctl mask shairport-sync
    ```

    or you can try to run one of them on a different port - Snapcast docs shows how to do this here: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#airplay>

***

Source code: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast>

## Snapcast Client

A FOSS multi room audio solution - this part is a client app it listens to the server and plays the audio it is sent

![Snapcast logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-snapcast.png){: width="300" height="48" loading="lazy"}

The Snapcast client will prompt you for the server's IP and port when installing and will be setup to start on boot up. This should work for most people but there are additional configuration parameters that can be found in the Snapcast documentation: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast#client>

=== "Changing options"

    It should just work but, you can change the available options in:

    - `/etc/default/snapclient`

    Then restart services with:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart snapclient
    ```
