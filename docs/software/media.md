## Airsonic-Advanced {: #airsonic }

Feature rich media streaming server with a web interface, coded in Java.

![Airsonic logo](../assets/images/airsonic-logo.svg){: width="350" height="100" loading="lazy"}

=== "Web interface"

    The web interface uses port **8080**:

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>:8080/airsonic`
    - Username: `admin`
    - Password: `admin`

    !!! hint "The web interface may feel sluggish on first access."

        This is normal on first access after service start. Once a page has been viewed, respectively an element selected the first time, subsequent accesses will perform much faster.

=== "First run setup"

    Once connected to the web interface for the first time, we recommend to do the following setup steps:

    First we check off the **Getting started** page and head over to **Settings**:

    !["Getting started" page](../assets/images/airsonic_setup_1.png){: width="1440" height="900" loading="lazy"}

    On the **Media folders** tab we change the path to DietPi's default music directory `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/Music`, save and scan the new media directory:

    !["Media folders" settings page](../assets/images/airsonic_setup_2.png){: width="1440" height="900" loading="lazy"}

    On the **Credentials** tab we add a new admin password, the default `bcrypt` encoding is very good for secure password storage. Then we delete the initial default password:

    !["Credentials" settings page](../assets/images/airsonic_setup_3.png){: width="1440" height="900" loading="lazy"}

=== "Setup details"

    The install, config and data directory is located at:

    ```
    /mnt/dietpi_userdata/airsonic
    ```

=== "Service control"

    Since Airsonic-Advanced runs as systemd service, it can be controlled with the following commands:

    ```sh
    systemctl status airsonic
    ```

    ```sh
    systemctl start airsonic
    ```

    ```sh
    systemctl stop airsonic
    ```

    ```sh
    systemctl restart airsonic
    ```

=== "Logs"

    Since Airsonic-Advanced runs as systemd service, its logs can be viewed via:

    ```sh
    journalctl -u airsonic
    ```

=== "Update"

    Airsonic-Advanced can be updated by simply reinstalling it:

    ```sh
    dietpi-software reinstall 33
    ```

## Shairport Sync

Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player which plays audio streamed from iTunes, iOS devices and third-party AirPlay sources such as ForkedDaapd and Airfoil.  
Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the source and hence with similar devices playing the same source. This allows for synchronised multi-room audio on multiple devices.

![Shairport Sync connection scheme](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-shairportsync.png){: width="400" height="233" loading="lazy"}

=== "AirPlay device name"

    When searching for an Airplay device, execute `shairport-sync` on DietPi.

=== "Stream from Android and iPad/iPhone"

    There are many AirPlay players available for Android (e.g. [AirPlay For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.screen.mirroring.airplay.streamtotv&hl=de)) and iPad/iPhone (e.g. [AirPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204289)).  
    Download and use the player of your choice.

=== "Stream from a Windows/Mac PC"

    Airfoil is an application that will let you stream audio playback directly to any Shairport Sync device. Press play on your favourite music player (e.g.: Winamp/Spotify) and click the speaker next to the DietPi device.

=== "Audiophiles - Master music in real time"

    By using a PC + [Airfoil](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/), you can master the music in real time using the PCs CPU. This will allow all your Shairport Sync devices to sound even better without any performance hit on the device.

=== "Multiple Shairport devices / Change Shairport Sync name"

    If you are planning to use multiple Shairport devices on the same network, please make sure the hostname of each device is unique. The hostname will also effect the `shairport-sync` name.  
    This can be completed in `dietpi-config` \> `Security Options` \> `Change Hostname`.

=== "Soxr interpolation"

    Soxr interpolation will improve the output audio quality on Shairport. However, it is extremely CPU intensive.  
    Enable Soxr:

    ```sh
    sed -i '/interpolation = /c\interpolation = "soxr";' /usr/local/etc/shairport-sync.conf
    systemctl restart shairport-sync
    ```

    Disable Soxr:

    ```sh
    sed -i '/interpolation = /c\\/\/interpolation = "soxr";' /usr/local/etc/shairport-sync.conf
    systemctl restart shairport-sync
    ```

    If you have choppy playback using Soxr:  
    Increasing the `shairplay-sync` process priority (nice) may resolve the issue.

    - Run `dietpi-services` from the terminal
    - Select `shairport-sync` via up/down buttons then press ++enter++
    - Select `CPU Nice` via up/down buttons then press ++enter++
    - Select `-20 : (Highest priority)` via up button, then press ++enter++

    DietPi will then automatically apply and set the nice level.

    If the choppy playback continues, the CPU most likely is insufficient for the processing required for Soxr. Then Soxr should be disabled.

## ReadyMedia

Stream your shared media to any DLNA/UPnP capable device.

![ReadyMedia logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-readymedia.jpg){: width="351" height="341" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access to ReadyMedia status"

    The web interface is accessible via port **8200**:

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>:8200`

=== "Transfer media files to DietPi"

    Make sure you have one of DietPi's [File Servers](../file_servers/) installed.  
    Default media directories:

    - Audio: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/Music`, `/Music` from NFS/Samba
    - Video: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/Video`, `/Video` from NFS/Samba
    - Images: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/Pictures`, `/Pictures` from NFS/Samba

=== "Refresh the ReadyMedia database"

    The database can be refreshed with this command:

    ```sh
    rm -r /mnt/dietpi_userdata/.MiniDLNA_Cache/* && systemctl restart minidlna
    ```

***

Available UPnP clients: <https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UPnP_AV_media_servers_and_clients#UPnP_AV_clients>

## Ampache

A web based audio/video streaming application and file manager allowing you to access your music & videos from anywhere, using almost any internet enabled device.

Also Installs:

- Webserver stack

![Ampache web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-ampacheinterface.png){: width="400" height="202" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access to the web interface"

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>/ampache`
    - Username: `admin`
    - Password: `dietpi`

=== "Transfer media files to DietPi"

    Make sure you have one of DietPi's [File Servers](../file_servers/) installed.  
    Default media directories:

    - Audio: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/Music`, `/Music` from NFS/Samba
    - Video: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/Video`, `/Video` from NFS/Samba

=== "Update media database"

    DietPi will automatically add various catalogue directories to Ampache during installation. You can modify these directories as needed before running your first scan.  
    To start the scan and import your media into Ampache:

    - Select the `admin` button.
    - Select `show catalogues` from the left hand side.
    - Select `Update all`.

    ![Ampache web interface screenshot with database update instructions](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-ampacheupdatecatalogue.png){: width="400" height="193" loading="lazy"}

=== "Add media directories"

    - Select the `admin` button.
    - Select `add a catalogue` from the left hand side.
    - Enter the details of your path.
    - Select the `add catalogue` button.

    ![Ampache web interface screenshot with instructions how to add media](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-ampacheaddcatalogue.png){: width="400" height="180" loading="lazy"}

    !!! note "Access permissions on local directories"
        If Ampache fails to add a directory, assure it has read permissions, e.g. by adding global read permissions:

        ```sh
        chmod -R a+r /my/directory
        ```

    !!! note "Access permissions on remote mounts (e.g. NFS, Samba)"
        In case you want to access a remote mount, also read permissions for Ampache need to be assured.

        - For NFS, you can grant global read permissions like you would do with a local directory, e.g. via:

            ```sh
            chmod -R a+r /my/nfs/directory
            ```

            In case the the NFS client has no write permissions, this needs to be done at the NFS server.

        - For Samba, edit `/etc/fstab` and add or set the mount options `file_mode=0775,dir_mode=0775`. Important is the last digit of each mode, which indicates read (and execute) permissions for all users. Stricter modes, still working with Ampache, would be: `file_mode=0644,dir_mode=0755`  
            Then remount the the Samba share for the change to take effect:

            ```sh
            mount -o remount /my/samba/directory
            ```

=== "Configuration"

    Since Debian Bullseye (Ampache v5), the main configuration file is located at:

    ```
    /mnt/dietpi_userdata/ampache/config/ampache.cfg.php
    ```

    Until Debian Buster (Ampache v4), the main configuration file is located at:

    ```
    /var/www/ampache/config/ampache.cfg.php
    ```

=== "Enable additional file formats via transcoding"

    E.g. to allow .m4a playback:

    - Since Debian Bullseye (Ampache v5):

        ```sh
        G_CONFIG_INJECT 'transcode_m4a[[:blank:]]' 'transcode_m4a = allowed' /mnt/dietpi_userdata/ampache/config/ampache.cfg.php
        ```

    - Until Debian Buster (Ampache v4):

        ```sh
        G_CONFIG_INJECT 'transcode_m4a[[:blank:]]' 'transcode_m4a = allowed' /var/www/ampache/config/ampache.cfg.php
        ```

    More info: <https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/Transcoding>

=== "Update Ampache"

    To update Ampache to the current version, execute

    ```sh
    dietpi-software reinstall 40
    ```

## Emby

A web interface media streaming server. Think Kodi, but using any device with a web browser.

??? note "Transcoding performance on SBC"

    Video transcoding performance on SBC devices is sluggish and may stutter, even on the RPi 3:  
    <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/310#issuecomment-216262850>  
    SBCs should be fine for Music only.  
    A Virtual Machine is highly recommended for Video transcoding:  
    <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/310#issuecomment-219067830>

![Snapcast logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-snapcast.png){: width="300" height="48" loading="lazy"}

The Snapcast server needs to have its audio sources manually configured after installation. See the Snapcast documents for more details: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast#server>

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The Snapcast server provides a web interface on port **1780**, which allows you to control volumes for all clients and optionally play audio through your browser:

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>:1780`

=== "Implementation details"

    DietPi-Software installs the Snapcast server nearly with default configs, as shipped with the official package. Only the JSON RPC, which listens by default on port **1705**, is disabled. To enable and configure it, check the `[tcp]` section of the config file (see "Changing options" tab).

=== "Changing options"

    - `/etc/snapserver.conf`

    Then restart services with:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart snapserver
    ```

    If you have MPD installed you can use it as an input source.

    First you need to ensure that MPD outputs to a pipe you can do this in two ways:

    1. Install CAVA from the DietPi software list.
    2. OR: Add the following to `/etc/mpd.conf` and restart with `systemctl restart mpd`

        ```
        audio_output {
            type "fifo"
            enabled "yes"
            name "snapcast"
            path "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
            format "48000:16:2"
        }
        ```

    Once you have done that you then need to add the following to `/etc/snapserver.conf` under `[stream]`. The `name` is the name as it will appear to Snapcast clients here I have called it `myMPD`. Check the Snapcast server docs for additional parameters you can pass in: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#pipe>

    ```
    source = pipe:///tmp/mpd.fifo?name=myMPD&mode=read
    ```

=== "Using Mopidy as an input source"

    If you have Mopidy installed you can use it as an input source.

    First you need to ensure that Mopidy outputs to a pipe. Add the following to `/etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf` and restart with `systemctl restart mopidy`

    ```
    [audio]
    output = audioresample ! audioconvert ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2,format=S16LE ! wavenc ! filesink location=/tmp/mopidy.fifo
    ```

    Once you have done that you then need to add the following to `/etc/snapserver.conf` under `[stream]`. The `name` is the name as it will appear to Snapcast clients here I have called it `myMopidy`. Check the Snapcast server docs for additional parameters you can pass in: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#pipe>

    ```
    source = pipe:///tmp/mopidy.fifo?name=myMopidy&mode=read
    ```

=== "Using Raspotify/librespot as an input source"

    If you have Raspotify installed you can use it as an input source.

    Add the following config under `[stream]`. The `name` is the name as it will appear to Snapcast clients here I have called it `mySpotify`. The `devicename` is the name that will be shown when connecting in Spotify. Check the Snapcast server docs for additional parameters you can pass in: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#librespot>. I have disabled the audio cache to protect the SD card.

    ```
    source = librespot:///usr/bin/librespot?name=mySpotify&devicename=SnapcastSpotify&disable_audio_cache=true
    ```

=== "Using AirPlay (Shairport Sync) as an input"

    First install `shairport-sync`.

    Then (at the moment - see: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/4470>) we need to replace the Shairport Sync binary with one that supports `stdout`. To do this we need to compile a new binary - you will find details here:  
    <https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync/blob/master/INSTALL.md#build-and-install>

    You need to use this line when configuring instead of the line from the docs:

    ```sh
    ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --with-alsa --with-soxr --with-avahi --with-ssl=openssl --with-systemd --with-metadata --with-stdout
    ```

    Don't forget to run `make` and `make install`.

    Then add the following config under `[stream]`. The `name` is the name as it will appear to Snapcast clients here I have called it `myAirport`. The `devicename` is the name that will be shown when searching for Airport devices. Check the Snapcast server docs for additional parameters you can pass in: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#airplay>

    ```
    source = airplay:///usr/local/bin/shairport-sync?name=myAirport&devicename=SnapcastAirport&params=--configfile=/usr/local/etc/shairport-sync.conf
    ```

    You will then either need to mask the original Shairport Sync service

    ```sh
    systemctl mask shairport-sync
    ```

    or you can try to run one of them on a different port - Snapcast docs shows how to do this here: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#airplay>

## Snapcast Client

A FOSS multi room audio solution - this part is a client app it listens to the server and plays the audio it is sent

![Snapcast logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-snapcast.png){: width="300" height="48" loading="lazy"}

The Snapcast client will prompt you for the server's IP and port when installing and will be setup to start on boot up. This should work for most people but there are additional configuration parameters that can be found in the Snapcast documentation: <https://github.com/badaix/snapcast#client>

=== "Changing options"

    It should just work but, you can change the available options in:

    - `/etc/default/snapclient`

    Then restart services with:

    ```sh
    systemctl restart snapclient
    ```

## Navidrome

An open source web-based music collection server and streamer, written in Go.  
It is compatible with the [Subsonic media player](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp).

![Navidrome web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-media-navidrome.png){: width="400" height="202" loading="lazy"}

=== "Web interface"

    The web interface uses port **4533**:

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>:4533`

=== "Multiple Music Folders"

    Navidrome doesn't support multiple music folders out of the box. The feature is still being developed.

    Related GitHub issue: <https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/issues/192>

=== "Setup details"

    The install, config and data directory is located at:

    ```
    /mnt/dietpi_userdata/navidrome
    ```

=== "Service control"

    Since Navidrome runs as systemd service, it can be controlled with the following commands:

    ```sh
    systemctl status navidrome
    ```

    ```sh
    systemctl start navidrome
    ```

    ```sh
    systemctl stop navidrome
    ```

    ```sh
    systemctl restart navidrome
    ```

=== "Logs"

    Since Navidrome runs as systemd service, its logs can be viewed via:

    ```sh
    journalctl -u navidrome
    ```

=== "Update"

    Navidrome can be updated by simply reinstalling it:

    ```sh
    dietpi-software reinstall 204
    ```

=== "Transfer music to DietPi"

    Make sure you have one of DietPi's [File Servers](../file_servers/) installed.  
    Default music directory:

    - `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/Music`, `/Music` from NFS/Samba

=== "Clients for Navidrome"

    Navidrome has a Subsonic-compatible server built in, so there should be plenty of clients for different platforms available. See:

    - <https://www.navidrome.org/docs/overview/#apps>
    - <http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp>
