## Nextcloud - Self-hosted productivity platform

Nextcloud gives you access to all your files wherever you are. Store your documents, calendar, contacts and photos on a server at home, at one of our providers or in a data center you trust.

=== "Quick start"

    Access the web interface using the next URL when running on SBC (`http://localhost/nextcloud/`) or the IP address / hostname of your DietPi device (e.g.: `http://192.168.0.100/nextcloud/`).

    ```
    username = admin
    password = <your global password>
    ```

    Nextcloud is installed together with the webserver. To fast access the files, a dedicated USB hard drive is highly recommended.

=== "Advanced configuration"

    For an advanced setup you could further configure your Nextcloud setup from the command line - see the [Nextcloud Admin guide](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/17/admin_manual/configuration_server/occ_command.html).

    To simplify this configuration, DietPi has added a shortcut to the otherwise necessary `sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ`. Just use inside your terminal:
    ```
    ncc [followed by the desired command]
    ```

=== "FAQ"

    **Where is my data stored ?**
    /mnt/dietpi_userdata/nextcloud_data (or dietpi.txt choice)

    **Why am I limited to 2GB file size uploads ?**
    DietPi will automatically apply the max supported upload size to the PHP and Nextcloud configs.
    - 32bit systems can handle 2 GB
    - 64bit systems can handle 8796 PB (petabytes)

    **Will my data be saved after deinstallation?**
    Your userdata directory will stay after deinstallation. As well a database backup will be saved to your userdata directory. Thus you can easily restore your instance by reinstalling Nextcloud and restore the database dump.
