## ownCloud

The ownCloud package turns your DietPi system into your very own personal cloud based backup/data storage system (e.g.: Dropbox).

Also Installs:

- Webserver
- USB dedicated hard drive highly recommended

![ownCloud web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-cloud-owncloud.png){: width="400" height="218" loading="lazy"}

=== "Quick start"

    ownCloud is accessible via regular HTTP/HTTPS TCP ports **80**/**443** below the `/owncloud` path:

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>/owncloud`
    - Username: `admin` (or the one you set in `dietpi.txt`)
    - Password: `<your global password>` (default: `dietpi`)

=== "Configuration"

    You can configure ownCloud via CLI from command line. To simplify this, DietPi has added a shortcut to the otherwise necessary `sudo -u www-data php /var/www/owncloud/occ`.  
    Simply run `occ` from your console:

    ```sh
    occ list
    ```

    More details about available commands can be found in the [ownCloud admin manual](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/next/admin_manual/configuration/server/occ_command.html#core-commands).

=== "Update"

    1. Option: Use the web-based updater from within the ownCloud web UI settings.
    2. Option: Use the updater script from console (recommended):

        ```sh
        sudo -u www-data php /var/www/owncloud/updater/application.php
        1
        ```

    3. Follow the official documentation for a manual upgrade process: <https://doc.owncloud.com/server/next/admin_manual/maintenance/upgrading/manual_upgrade.html>

=== "FAQ"

    **Where is my data stored?**

    `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/owncloud_data` (or `dietpi.txt` choice)

    **Why am I limited to 2 GiB file size uploads?**

    DietPi will automatically apply the max supported upload size to the PHP and ownCloud configs.

    - 32-bit systems can handle 2 GiB
    - 64-bit systems can handle 8796 PiB, yep, in petabyte
    - `echo -e "$(( $(php -r 'print(PHP_INT_MAX);') / 1024 / 1024)) MiB"`

    **Will my data be saved after deinstallation?**

    Your userdata directory will stay after deinstallation.  
    As well a database backup will be saved to your userdata directory. Thus you can easily restore your instance by reinstalling ownCloud and restore the database dump.

## Nextcloud

Nextcloud gives you access to all your files wherever you are. Store your documents, calendar, contacts and photos on a server at home, at one of our providers or in a data center you trust.

![Nextcloud web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-cloud-nextcloud.jpg){: width="2048" height="1280" loading="lazy"}

=== "Quick start"

    Nextcloud is accessible via regular HTTP/HTTPS ports **80**/**443** below the `/nextcloud` path:

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>/nextcloud`
    - Username: `admin` (or the one you set in `dietpi.txt`)
    - Password: `<your global password>` (default: `dietpi`)

=== "Configuration"

    You can configure Nextcloud via CLI from command line. To simplify this, DietPi has added a shortcut to the otherwise necessary `sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ`.  
    Simply run `ncc` from your console:

    ```sh
    ncc list
    ```

    More details about available commands can be found in the [Nextcloud admin manual](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/occ_command.html).

=== "Brute-force protection"

    Nextcloud offers built-in brute force protection and additionally a plugin ***Brute-force settings***.  
    This will delay your login rate in case of several failed login attempts.

    This protection can be extended with Fail2Ban (see following tab).

    See also:

    - <https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/bruteforcesettings>
    - <https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/bruteforce_configuration.html>

=== "Fail2Ban integration"

    Using Fail2Ban your can block users after failed login attempts. This hardens your system, e.g. against brute force attacks.

    - Set options in the ***Nextcloud configuration file*** (typical `/var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php`):

        - Add trusted domains if not already set via the `'trusted_domains'` entry.

            ```ini
            'trusted_domains' =>
             array (
               0 => 'localhost',
               1 => '<your_trusted_domain>',
             ),
            ```

            The entry of the trusted domains is important, because one of the Fail2Ban regular expressions in the Fail2Ban filter file ("Trusted domain error", see below) deals with trusted domain login errors. By default, if you login via a non trusted domain, Nextcloud will show an error login dialog.  

            !!! attention
              Take care, if you use this "Trusted domain error" `failregex` option and you then reload the page several times (more often than `maxretry` value in the Fail2Ban jail file) you lockout yourself also for logging in via a trusted domain from the IP address you are using.

        - log file options: These are set to appropriate values by default (e.g. `log_level`, `log_type`) resp. DietPi defaults (`logfile` via `SOFTWARE_NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR` within `/boot/dietpi.txt`), so that they do not need to be set as sometimes otherwise described.

    - Create new ***Fail2Ban filter*** (e.g. `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nextcloud.conf`):

        ```ini
        # Fail2Ban filter for Nextcloud

        [Definition]
        _groupsre = (?:(?:,?\s*"\w+":(?:"[^"]+"|\w+))*)
        failregex = ^\{%(_groupsre)s,?\s*"remoteAddr":"<HOST>"%(_groupsre)s,?\s*"message":"Login failed:
                    ^\{%(_groupsre)s,?\s*"remoteAddr":"<HOST>"%(_groupsre)s,?\s*"message":"Trusted domain error.
        datepattern = ,?\s*"time"\s*:\s*"%%Y-%%m-%%d[T ]%%H:%%M:%%S(%%z)?"
        ```

    - Create new ***Fail2Ban jail file*** `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/nextcloud.local`:

        ```ini
        [nextcloud]
        backend = auto
        enabled = true
        port = http,https
        protocol = tcp
        filter = nextcloud
        maxretry = 5
        bantime = 600
        logpath = /mnt/dietpi_userdata/nextcloud_data/nextcloud.log
        ```

        Check whether the `logpath` is identical to the value in the Nextcloud configuration file (`config.php`see above).

        As not specified here, Fail2Ban uses properties like `maxretry`, `bantime`, etc. from `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf` or `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` (if present). Note the setting `backend = auto`. By default, `backend` is set to `systemd` in `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf`. As a result, Fail2Ban ignores the `logpath` entry here in the jail `nextcloud.conf`, with the consequence, that Fail2Ban does not recognize an attack on Nextcloud (port 80, 443) even though attacks are listed in `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/nextcloud_data/nextcloud.log`.

    - Restart Fail2Ban: `systemctl restart fail2ban`.
    - Test your settings by trying to sign in multiple times from a remote PC with a wrong user or password. After `maxretry` attempts your IP must be banned for `bantime` seconds (DietPi does not respond anymore) as the default action by Fail2Ban is `route`, specified in `/etc/fail2ban/action.d/route.conf`.
    - Check the current status on your DietPi with `fail2ban-client status nextcloud`.
    - See also:
        - [Fail2Ban](../system_security/#fail2ban-protects-your-system-from-brute-force-attacks)
        - <https://help.nextcloud.com/t/repeated-login-attempts-from-china/6510/11?u=michaing>
        - <https://www.c-rieger.de/nextcloud-installationsanleitung/#c06>

=== "Update"

    1. Option: Use the web-based updater from within the Nextcloud web UI settings.
    2. Option: Use the updater script from console (recommended):

        ```sh
        phpenmod phar # The PHP Phar module is required
        sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/updater/updater.phar
        y # Starts download and install of files
        y # Starts the internal database upgrade and migration steps
        N # Do not keep maintenance mode active
        ```

    3. Follow the official documentation for a manual upgrade process: <https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/maintenance/manual_upgrade.html>

=== "FAQ"

    **Where is my data stored?**

    `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/nextcloud_data` (or `dietpi.txt` choice)

    **Why am I limited to 2 GiB file size uploads?**

    DietPi will automatically apply the max supported upload size to the PHP and Nextcloud configs.

    - 32-bit systems can handle 2 GiB
    - 64-bit systems can handle 8796 PiB, yep, in petabyte
    - `echo -e "$(( $(php -r 'print(PHP_INT_MAX);') / 1024 / 1024)) MiB"`

    **Will my data be saved after deinstallation?**

    Your user data directory will stay after deinstallation. As well a database backup will be saved to your user data directory. Thus you can easily restore your instance by reinstalling Nextcloud and restore the database dump.

    **How can I check my OPcache status?**

    PHP uses a so called *OPcache* to store PHP scripts in optimised *opcode* format in RAM, which speeds up browser access as the raw PHP scripts do not need to be read from disk and parsed first.  
    The Nextcloud admin panel includes a check for sufficient OPcache settings and in case shows a recommendation for settings to apply. If such appears, we recommend to apply them with an own configuration file, e.g.:

    ```sh
    echo -e '; Custom Nextcloud OPcache settings\n; priority=99\nopcache.memory_consumption=128' > /etc/php/7.4/mods-available/custom.ini
    phpenmod custom
    ```

    You can watch the actual usage with the pre-installed [opcache-gui](https://github.com/amnuts/opcache-gui){:class="nospellcheck"} by @amnuts.

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>/opcache.php`

    ![OPcache statistics page](../assets/images/OpCache_php_output.png){: width="700" height="976" loading="lazy"}

    The dialog shows the cache status as well as the settings.

    **What shall I do about missing `bcmath`, `gmp` and `imagick` PHP modules?**

    After a fresh install via `dietpi-software`, the Nextcloud admin panel shows warnings about three missing modules. We propose to ignore them: `imagick` is not needed at all and a subject of discussion about security issues, `bcmath` and `gmp` are required only if you want to use the WebAuthn passwordless authentication with Nextcloud.  
    If you must mute those warnings, you can install the modules manually:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install php-bcmath php-gmp php-imagick libmagickcore-6.q16-6-extra
    ```

    The `imagick` related warning can be solved alternatively by disabling the `Theming` app (in the Nextcloud apps settings), if no manual theming is done to the Nextcloud instance anyway.

## Nextcloud Talk

Host video calls on your own Nextcloud instance. The TURN server ***Coturn*** will be installed and configured as well to allow reliable video calls through outside the local network, NAT and firewall setups.

Also installs:

- [**Nextcloud**](#nextcloud)
- **Coturn**

![Nextcloud Talk app screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-cloud-nextcloudtalk.png){: width="2560" height="1440" loading="lazy"}

=== "Installation notes"

    For video call throughout your local network, a so called [TURN server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT) is required. *Coturn* is a common implementation and hence installed by default together with our Nextcloud Talk option.

    During installation you will be asked to enter your server's external domain and a port, that you want to use for the Coturn TURN server. Note that you need to forward the chosen port and/or open it in your firewall.

    Coturn will be configured with authentication via shared secret and some additional security measures. For details, see this HowTo: <https://help.nextcloud.com/t/howto-setup-nextcloud-talk-with-turn-server/30794>

        - Database = `pydio`
        - User = `pydio`
        - Password = `<your global password>` (default: `dietpi`)
        - Use MySqli = No
    - Click test connection, when successful, click the `>>` button.
    - Under advanced options, use the default values, then click the `Install Pydio` button.

=== "Setup sync client on remote systems"

    Once the server has been configured (as per above):

    - Download the sync client for your system: <https://pydio.com/en/get-pydio/downloads/pydiosync-desktop-app>
    - When configuring the remote server, use the following:
        - Select HTTP option (unless you have setup an SSL cert)
        - URL = `http://<your.IP>/pydio` (replace IP with your system IP)
        - User = The "admin" user you setup in initial setup.
        - Password = The "admin" password you setup in initial setup.

## UrBackup

UrBackup Server is an Open Source client/server backup system, that through a combination of image and file backups accomplishes both data safety and a fast restoration time.  
Basically, it allows you to create a complete system backup for systems on your network, using a simple web interface.  
Clients are available for Windows, macOS, Linux and FreeBSD.

![UrBackup interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-cloud-urbackup.png){: width="400" height="103" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The web interface is accessible via TCP port **55414**:

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>:55414`

=== "Configuration"

    The **configuration of UrBackup** is within these options:

    - UrBackup web interface, tab `Settings`
    - UrBackup configuration file, `/etc/default/urbackupsrv`  

        After editing the config file, the service needs to be restart for changes to take effect:

        ```sh
        systemctl restart urbackupsrv
        ```

    **Best practice: Disable "Allow client-side pausing of backups"**  
    Backup procedures sometimes are paused by the client side which leads to a long backup duration. To avoid this the pausing can be deactivated via the UrBackup web interface:

    - Select `Settings`
    - Select tab `General` -> `Permissions`
    - Uncheck option `Allow client-side pausing of backups`
    - Alternatively this can also be set via the client resp. group based settings in the `Settings` area

=== "Backup storage path"

    The location of the backups can be set **prior to installing UrBackup** via `SOFTWARE_URBACKUP_BACKUPPATH` setting in `/boot/dietpi.txt`. It defaults to `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/urbackup`.

    After the installation, the path can be changed via web interface:

    - Select `Settings`
    - Select tab `General` -> `Server`
    - Change `Backup Storage Path`
    - Click `Save`

    ???+ note "Backup storage directory and access rights"
        It is necessary that the new backup directory exists, as UrBackup usually has no permissions to pre-create it.  
        Additionally, you need to grant UrBackup write access. It can be achieved via

        ```sh
        mkdir /path/to/backup/storage
        chmod -R urbackup:urbackup /path/to/backup/storage
        ```

=== "Download the client"

    Install the appropriate client on the systems you wish to backup from <https://www.urbackup.org/download.html#client_windows>.  
    Remark: For Windows 7 (outdated), the [client version 2.4.11](https://www.urbackup.org/downloads/Client/2.4.11/) has to be used.

=== "Download cache"

    Via web interface `Settings` > `Advanced` section, a temporary download buffer can be enabled, where backups are stored to during download, before being moved to the final backup path. See the [corresponding UrBackup documentation chapter](https://www.urbackup.org/administration_manual.html#x1-700008.5.1) for details.  
    By default the `/tmp` tmpfs (RAM disk) is used for this, which causes issues if you do not have several free GiB of RAM. The directory can be changed via:

    ```sh
    nano /etc/default/urbackupsrv
    ```

    The relevant entry is `DAEMON_TMPDIR`:

    ```sh
    #Temporary file directory
    # -- this may get very large depending on the advanced settings
    DAEMON_TMPDIR='/tmp'
    ```

    Note that this means doubled file writes and has no benefits as long as the backup duration from clients' side is not time critical, or your backup drive is not very slow. It makes sense only if you have a much faster drive available, or plenty GiB of free RAM to use as backup download buffer.

=== "View logs"

    UrBackup logs to `/var/log/urbackup.log` by default. The path to the log file can be changed via `/etc/default/urbackupsrv`. See "Configuration" tab for details.

=== "Update"

    You can easily update UrBackup by reinstalling it. Your settings and data are preserved:

    ```sh
    dietpi-software reinstall 111
    ```

## Gogs

Your very own GitHub style server, with web interface.

![Gogs web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-cloud-gogs.png){: width="400" height="175" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The web interface is accessible via TCP port **3000**:

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>:3000`

=== "First run setup"

    Has to be done once, when connected to the web interface:

    - Change the following values only:
        - Database Type: `MySQL`
        - Host: `/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock`
        - Password: `<your global password>` (default: `dietpi`)
        - Repository Root Path: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/gogs-repo`
        - Run User: `gogs`
        - Domain: `<your.domain/IP>`
        - Application URL: `http://<your.domain/IP>:3000/`
        - Log Path: `/var/log/gogs`
    - Scroll to the bottom of page and select "Install Gogs".
    - Depending on whether the application URL above was entered correctly/is accessible by the connected browser, you may need to reconnect to the web page using the IP address, e.g.: `http://<your.IP>:3000`
    - Once the page has reloaded, you will need to click `Register` to create the admin account.

=== "External access"

    If you wish to allow external access to your Gogs server, you will need to setup port forwarding on your router, pointing to the IP address of your DietPi device.

    - Port: 3000
    - Protocol: TCP+UDP

    If an external access is used, HTTPS is strongly recommended to increase your system security. You can get a free certificate e.g. via [dietpi-letsencrypt](../../dietpi_tools/#dietpi-letsencrypt){:class="nospellcheck"}.

=== "View logs"

    Initial service logs can be viewed via:

    ```sh
    journalctl -u gogs
    ```

    Daemon logs can be found in the following directory:

    ```
    /var/log/gogs
    ```

=== "Update to latest version"

    You can easily update Gogs by reinstalling it. Your settings and data are preserved by this:

    ```sh
    dietpi-software reinstall 49
    ```

## Gitea

Your very own GitHub style server, with web interface.

![Gitea logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-cloud-gitea.jpg){: width="320" height="200" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The web interface is accessible via port **3000**:

    - URL: `http://<your.IP>:3000`

=== "First run setup"

    Has to be done once, when connected to the web interface:

    - Change the following values only:
        - Host: `/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock`
        - Password: `<your global password>` (default: `dietpi`)
        - Server Domain: `<your.domain/IP>`
        - Gitea Base URL: `http://<your.domain/IP>:3000/`
        - Log Path: `/var/log/gitea` (However, file logging is disabled by default.)
    - Scroll to the bottom of page and select "Install Gitea".
    - Depending on whether the base URL above was entered correctly/is accessible by the connected browser, you may need to reconnect to the web page using the IP address, e.g.: `http://<your.IP>:3000`
    - Once the page has reloaded, you will need to click `Register` to create the admin account.

=== "External access"

    If you wish to allow external access to your Gitea server, you will need to setup port forwarding on your router, pointing to the IP address of your DietPi device.

    - Port: 3000
    - Protocol: TCP+UDP

    If an external access is used, HTTPS is strongly recommended to increase your system security. You can get a free certificate e.g. via [dietpi-letsencrypt](../../dietpi_tools/#dietpi-letsencrypt){:class="nospellcheck"}.

=== "Fail2Ban integration"

    Using Fail2Ban your can block IP addresses after failed login attempts. This hardens your system against e.g. brute-force attacks.

    === "When using journal logging (default)"

        By default Gitea logs to the systemd journal (see "View logs" tab), in which case Fail2Ban protection can be enabled with the following steps:

        Create a new filter `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/gitea.conf`:

        ```ini
        [Definition]
        journalmatch = _SYSTEMD_UNIT=gitea.service
        failregex = Failed authentication attempt for \x1b\[1m.+\x1b\[0m from \x1b\[1m<HOST>:\d+\x1b\[0m:
        ```

        Create a new jail `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/gitea.conf`:

        ```ini
        [gitea]
        enabled = true
        backend = systemd
        ```

    === "When using file logging"

        When file logging is enabled (see "View logs" tab), Fail2Ban protection can be enabled with the following steps:

        Create a new filter `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/gitea.conf`:

        ```ini
        [Definition]
        failregex = Failed authentication attempt for .+ from <HOST>:\d+:
        ```

        Create a new jail `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/gitea.conf`:

        ```ini
        [gitea]
        enabled = true
        backend = auto
        logpath = /var/log/gitea/gitea.log
        ```

    You can specify other properties like `maxretry` or `bantime` to overwrite the defaults in `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf` or `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` if present. When done:

    - Restart Fail2Ban: `systemctl restart fail2ban`
    - Try to login to the Gitea web interface with a wrong password.
    - Check whether the failed login has been detected: `fail2ban-client status gitea`
    - When you further try to login `maxretry` times, your IP should be banned for `bantime` seconds, so that neither the Gitea web interface, nor SSH or any other network application will respond to requests from your client. When Fail2Ban was installed via `dietpi-software`, by default `route`/`blackhole` blocking is used, so that `ip r` on the server should show a `blackhole` route for your client's IP.
    - See also:
        - [Fail2Ban](../system_security/#fail2ban)
        - <https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/fail2ban-setup/>

=== "View logs"

    By default, logs can be viewed with the following command:

    ```sh
    journalctl -u gitea
    ```

    File logging to `/var/log/gitea/gitea.log` can be enabled by editing `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/gitea/custom/conf/app.ini` and changing `MODE = console` in the `[log]` section to `MODE = file`.

=== "Update to latest version"

    You can easily update Gitea by reinstalling it. Your settings and data are preserved by this:

    ```sh
    dietpi-software reinstall 165
    ```

## Syncthing

Backup and sync server with web interface. Extremely lightweight and efficient as no webserver is required.

![Syncthing interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-cloud-syncthing.png){: width="400" height="195" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The web interface is accessible via port **8384**:

    URL = `http://<your.IP>:8384`

=== "First run setup"

    Has to be done once, when connected to the web interface.

    - When the `Danger! Please set a GUI Authentication User and Password in the Settings dialog.` box appears, click the `settings` button inside the box.
    - Under `GUI Authentication User` and `GUI Authentication Password`: Enter new login details you would like to use for access to the web interface. Then click `save`.

    DietPi will automatically setup your default folder share to `/mnt/dietpi_userdata`.

=== "Setup a second system to sync with"

    In this example we will use a Windows system. The goal is to "sync" the user data from your DietPi device with another system.

    - Download, extract and run the Windows application `syncthing.exe`: <https://syncthing.net/downloads/>.
    - Syncthing web interface will load automatically, if not, you can access it via `http://127.0.0.1:8384/`.
        - Click `Actions` at the top right, then select `Show ID`. Copy the UUID code.
    - On the DietPi device, open the web interface and click `Add remote device` (bottom right).
        - Under `Device ID`, paste in the UUID we copied earlier.
        - Under `Device name`, enter any name. e.g.: *My Windows PC*.
        - Under `Share Folders With Device` tick/select DietPi user data, then click `save`.
    - After a few seconds, go back to the Windows web interface `http://127.0.0.1:8384/`. You should receive a message asking you to confirm the new device, click `Add Device`.
        - Under `Share Folders With Device` tick/select DietPi user data, then click `save`.

    You devices should now duplicate the user data from your DietPi device to your Windows PC.

## Firefox Sync Server

This is Mozilla's Firefox Sync Server which manages syncing Firefox instance bookmarks, history, tabs and passwords across devices. Out of the box it runs on a Python server for small loads and can be configured to run behind Nginx or Apache.

![Firefox Sync logo](../assets/images/dietpi-software-cloud-firefoxsyncserver.png){: width="300" height="95" loading="lazy"}

=== "Configure Firefox"

    - Open `about:config` to access advanced settings.
    - Search for: `identity.sync.tokenserver.uri`.
    - Set value to: `http://<your.IP>:5002/token/1.0/sync/1.5`.
        - We recommend to access your Firefox Sync Server only from local network or via VPN, keeping the default listening port **5002** closed for access from outside of your LAN.
        - If you need to access it remotely without VPN, adjust the `public_url` setting inside the config file `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/firefox-sync/syncserver.ini` to contain your public IP or domain and desired port.

=== "Directories"

    - Install directory: `/opt/firefox-sync`
    - Data directory: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/firefox-sync`
    - Config file: `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/firefox-sync/syncserver.ini`

=== "View logs"

    View the logs by executing:

     ```sh
     journalctl -u firefox-sync
     ```

=== "Update to latest version"

    You can easily update the Firefox Sync Server by reinstalling it. Your settings and data are preserved by this:

    ```sh
    dietpi-software reinstall 177
    ```

## vaultwarden

vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden password manager server with web interface, written in Rust.

![vaultwarden web vault screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-vaultwarden.jpg){: width="600" height="247" loading="lazy"}

=== "First access"

    - During install, a self-signed 4096-bit RSA TLS certificate is created to allow encrypted HTTPS access, which is required for access with most Bitwarden clients and reasonable as of the sensitivity of the data a password manager handles.
    - Most web browsers will warn you on access that the certificate is not trusted, although usually you can choose to ignore that and still access the web vault.
    - Most Bitwarden clients on the other hand will deny to access your server, as long as the certificate is not trusted.
    - As far as you have a public domain name for your DietPi server, we recommend to request an official trusted CA certificate, e.g. via `dietpi-letsencrypt` and setup either a reverse proxy, or configure vaultwarden to use the retrieved key and certificate directly via ROCKET_TLS setting in the config file (see "Directories" tab).
