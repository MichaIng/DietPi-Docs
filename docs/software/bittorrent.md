## Transmission

Transmission, the lightweight web interface BitTorrent server that allows you to download BitTorrent files.

!!! hint "USB dedicated hard drive highly recommended"

![Transmission web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-download-transmission.png){: width="500" height="334" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The web interface is accessible via port **9091**:

    - URL = `http://<your.IP>:9091`
    - Username = `root`
    - Password = `<your global password>`

=== "Access Downloads"

    Make sure you have one of DietPi's [File Servers](https://dietpi.com/docs/software/file_servers/) installed.  
    Folders used by Transmission:

    - folder accessed via file server = `downloads`
    - local folder = `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/downloads`

=== "Port closed Issues"

    DietPi sets up Transmission to use port forwarding on the router.  
    In rare cases this won't work with some routers and you will need to manually setup port forwarding:

    - Use TCP+UDP with the default DietPi transmission port of **51413**.
    - Point this port to the IP address of your DietPi system.

    Once port forwarding is setup, simply complete the following to update transmission:

    - Load up the transmission web interface
    - Click the `settings` button (bottom left spanner)
    - Click the `network` tab
    - Where is says `Use port forwarding on my router`, uncheck this box.

    Simply close and reopen this screen to refresh the port status.

=== "Recommended: Protect your privacy with a VPN"

    Although we enable forced encryption on all our BitTorrent clients, if you wish to ensure complete privacy and piece of mind for all your downloaded content, using a VPN is critical. We highly recommend [**NordVPN**](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=5305&url_id=902) as it offers unlimited bandwidth, zero logging and up to 6 devices on a single account. It can be easily setup using our [**DietPi-VPN**](../../dietpi_tools/#dietpi-vpn) tool.

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The web interface is accessible via port **1340**:

    - URL = `http://<your.IP>:1340`

    Folders used by qBittorrent:

    - Folder accessed via file server = `downloads`
    - Local folder = `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/downloads`

=== "Using of search plugins"

    Before activating search plugins within qBittorrent, you would need to install Python first. Afterwards you can search and activate the plugins.

## rTorrent

rTorrent is a BitTorrent server. ruTorrent is also installed to allow for web interface access and control.  

Also installs:

- Webserver

!!! hint "USB dedicated hard drive highly recommended"

![ruTorrent screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-download-rtorrent.png){: width="400" height="201" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access to the web interface"

    - URL = `http://<your.IP>/rutorrent`
    - Username = `root`
    - Password = `<your global password>`

    The login credentials can be changed, depending on the webserver choice, with the following commands:

    ```sh
    # With Lighttpd (default):
    echo "username:rtorrent:$(echo -n 'username:rtorrent:password' | md5sum | mawk '{print $1}')" > /etc/.rutorrent-htaccess

    # With Apache:
    htpasswd -c /etc/.rutorrent-htaccess

    # With Nginx:
    echo "username:$(openssl passwd -apr1 'password')" > /etc/.rutorrent-htaccess
    ```

=== "Access downloads"

    Make sure you have one of DietPi's [File Servers](https://dietpi.com/docs/software/file_servers/) installed.  
    Folders used by rTorrent:

    - Folder accessed via file server = `downloads`
    - Local folder = `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/downloads`

    Important note:  
    rTorrent creates a lock file based on the systems hostname. When the hostname is changed (e.g. via `dietpi-config` \> `Security Options`), then the old lock file needs to be removed to allow rTorrent creating a new one based on the new hostname:

    ```sh
    rm /mnt/dietpi_userdata/downloads/.session/rtorrent.lock
    systemctl restart rtorrent
    ```

=== "Access rTorrent RPC"

    rTorrent by default listens on the UNIX domain socket at `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/downloads/.session/rpc.socket`. The webserver is configured to proxy `http://<your.IP>/RPC2` calls to the UNIX socket, but HTTP authentication is enforced for that URL.

=== "Recommended: Protect your privacy with a VPN"

    Although we enable forced encryption on all our BitTorrent clients, if you wish to ensure complete privacy and piece of mind for all your downloaded content, using a VPN is critical. We highly recommend [**NordVPN**](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=5305&url_id=902) as it offers unlimited bandwidth, zero logging and up to 6 devices on a single account. It can be easily setup using our [**DietPi-VPN**](../../dietpi_tools/#dietpi-vpn) tool.  
    [![NordVPN logo](../assets/images/nordvpn-logo.svg){: width="300" height="65" loading="lazy"}](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=5305&url_id=902)

=== "View logs"

    To view rTorrent service logs, run the following command:

    ```sh
    journalctl -u rtorrent
    ```

    Issues with the web interface can be debugged via webserver logs:

    ```sh
    # With Lighttpd (default):
    journalctl -u lighttpd
    more /var/log/lighttpd/error.log

    # With Apache:
    journalctl -u apache2
    more /var/log/apache2/error.log

    # With Nginx:
    journalctl -u nginx
    more /var/log/nginx/error.log
    ```

=== "Update to latest version"

    rTorrent itself is installed via APT, and hence can be updated by running the following commands:

    ```sh
    apt update
    apt install rtorrent
    ```

    If the ruTorrent web interface shall be updated as well, easiest is a reinstall:

    ```sh
    dietpi-software reinstall 107
    ```

## Lidarr

Automatically download your favorite music.

??? note "A download client is required"

    Transmission BitTorrent server is recommended to enable automatic downloads

![Lidarr web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-download-lidarr.jpg){: width="400" height="205" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access to the web interface"

    The web interface is accessible via port **8686**:

    - URL = `http://<your.IP>:8686`

=== "First run setup"

    Before you can music, you'll need to select a search indexer to use from the web interface:

    - Simply go to `Settings` \> `Indexer` then choose at least one indexer.

    Setup your download client:

    - Simply go to `Settings` \> `Download Client`, select your installed download client and enter [required credentials](#transmission-lightweight-bittorrent-server-with-web-interface).

    Setup file creation mask:  
    If you require write access from other applications (e.g. Plex subtitle downloads), you'll also need to set the file/folder creation mask to allow this.

    - In the Sonarr web interface, select `Settings`
    - Toggle to `Advanced settings` slider (enable it)
    - Under `Media Management` tab, scroll down to the bottom of the page under Permissions, set the following values:

        ![Lidarr permissions options](../assets/images/dietpi-software-download-lidarrpermissions.png){: width="400" height="257" loading="lazy"}

    - Save changes

=== "Add a music"

    - Simply select `Artist` \> `Add New`
    - Type a name of the artist you wish to find
    - Once found, under root folder, use the following location `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/downloads`
    - Change any other settings as required, then select `Add`

=== "Using custom download/media directories"

    By default Lidarr has strict permissions to only access download and media directories inside `/mnt/`. If you need to use a different location, please do the following:

    1. Run `dietpi-services` from console
    2. Select `lidarr`
    3. Select `Edit`
    4. Uncomment (remove leading `#`) the line, starting with `ReadWritePaths=`
    5. Add your custom path to the end of this line, separated by one space
    6. Press ++ctrl+o++ buttons to save and ++ctrl+x++ to exit

=== "Link databases to RAM"

    Link the Lidarr info/settings database to RAM to increase access performance, reduce disk I/O and avoid constant external HDD spinning due to the very regular access to these files:

## Jackett

API Support for your favorite torrent trackers.

Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, Radarr, SickRage, CouchPotato) into tracker-site-specific HTTP queries, parses the HTML response, then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches.
