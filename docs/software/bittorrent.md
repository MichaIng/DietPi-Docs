## Transmission

Transmission, the lightweight web interface BitTorrent server that allows you to download BitTorrent files.

??? hint "USB dedicated hard drive highly recommended"

![DietPi download software Transmission](../assets/images/dietpi-software-download-transmission.png){: style="width:500px"}

=== "Access to the web interface"

    - URL = `http://<your.IP>:9091`
    - Username = `root`
    - Password = `<your global password>`

=== "Access Downloads"

    Make sure you have one of DietPi's [File Servers](https://dietpi.com/docs/software/file_servers/) installed.  
    Folders used by Transmission:

    - folder accessed via file server = `downloads`
    - local folder = `/mnt/dietpi_userdata/downloads`

=== "Port closed Issues"

    DietPi sets up Transmission to use port forwarding on the router.  
    In rare cases this won't work with some routers and you will need to manually setup port forwarding:

    - Use TCP+UDP with the default DietPi transmission port of 51413.
    - Point this port to the IP address of your DietPi system.

    Once port forwarding is setup, simply complete the following to update transmission:

    - Load up the transmission web interface
    - Click the `settings` button (bottom left spanner)
    - Click the `network` tab
    - Where is says `Use port forwarding on my router`, uncheck this box.

    Simply close and reopen this screen to refresh the port status.

=== "Recommended: Protect your privacy with a VPN"

    Although we enable forced encryption on all our BitTorrent clients, if you wish to ensure complete privacy and piece of mind for all your downloaded content, using a VPN is critical.  
    We highly recommend [***NordVPN***](../vpn/#dietpi-nordvpn-openvpn-and-dietpi-gui-for-nordvpn-users) as it offers unlimited bandwidth, zero logging and up to 6 devices on a single account.

    - Change any other settings as required, then select `Add`

=== "Using custom download/media directories"

    By default Lidarr has strict permissions to only access download and media directories inside `/mnt/`. If you need to use a different location, please do the following:

    1. Run `dietpi-services` from console
    2. Select `lidarr`
    3. Select `Edit`
    4. Uncomment (remove leading `#`) the line, starting with `ReadWritePaths=`
    5. Add your custom path to the end of this line, separated by one space
    6. Press `CTRL+o` buttons to save and `CTRL+x` to exit

=== "Link databases to RAM"

    Link the Lidarr info/settings database to RAM to increase access performance, reduce disk I/O and avoid constant external HDD spinning due to the very regular access to these files:

=== "Recommended: Protect your privacy with a VPN"

    Although we enable forced encryption on all our BitTorrent clients, if you wish to ensure complete privacy and piece of mind for all your downloaded content, using a VPN is critical.  
    We highly recommend [***NordVPN***](../vpn/#dietpi-nordvpn-openvpn-and-dietpi-gui-for-nordvpn-users) as it offers unlimited bandwidth, zero logging and up to 6 devices on a single account.

## Jackett

API Support for your favorite torrent trackers.

Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, Radarr, SickRage, CouchPotato) into tracker-site-specific HTTP queries, parses the HTML response, then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches.
