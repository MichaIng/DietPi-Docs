??? info "How do I run **DietPi-Software** and install **optimised software**?"
    To install any of the **DietPi optimised software** listed below run from the command line:

    ```sh
    dietpi-software
    ```

    Choose **Software Optimised** and select one or more items. Finally click on `Install`. DietPi will do all the necessary steps to install and start these software items.

## Pi-hole

Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole with web interface that will block ads for any device on your network.

- Also Installs: [Webserver stack](../webserver_stack/)

![Pi-hole web interface screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-dnsserver-pihole.png){: width="500" height="410" loading="lazy"}

=== "Access the web interface"

    The web interface of Pi-hole can be accessed via:

    - URL= `http://<your.IP>/admin`
    - Password = `<yourGlobalSoftwarePassword>` (default: `dietpi`)

=== "Configuration"

    The configuration contains setting devices (e.g. router) to use Pi-hole for DNS resolution.

    #### Option 1 - Setup single devices to use the Pi-hole DNS server

    Simply change your DNS settings to use the IP address of your Pi-hole device. This will need to be done for each device that you want Pi-hole to work with.

    Example:

    - My Pi-hole device has the IP address of 192.168.0.100
    - On my PC, I would set the DNS address to 192.168.0.100
    - Tutorial [The Ultimate Guide to Changing Your DNS settings](https://www.howtogeek.com/167533/the-ultimate-guide-to-changing-your-dns-server/).

    #### Option 2 - Setup your router to use the Pi-hole DNS server

    This method will automatically point every device (that uses DHCP) on your network to Pi-hole.
    On your routers control panel web page, you will need to find a option called "DNS server". This should be located under DHCP settings.

    Simply enter the IP address of your Pi-hole device under "DNS server":

    ![DietPi DNS server software router setup](../assets/images/dietpi-software-dnsserver-router-setup.png){: width="400" height="240" loading="lazy"}

    On your Pi-hole device, you will need to set a different DNS server.  
    Depending on your router configuration, if you don't do this step, the Pi-hole device may not be able to access the internet. It's highly recommended to have the device running Pi-hole, pointing to a DNS server outside your network.

    - Run the following command: `dietpi-config 8 1`
    - Select: *Ethernet*
    - If you are running in DHCP mode, select *Change Mode*, then select: *Copy Current address to Static*
    - Select *Static DNS* from the list, then choose a DNS server, or manually enter a custom entry.
    - Once completed, select *Apply* to save the changes.

=== "Updating Pi-hole"

    Pi-hole can be updated via the shell command `pihole -up`.

=== "Repairing Pi-hole"

    You can use `pihole -r` to repair or reconfigure your Pi-hole instance.

    !!! warning "No selection of Lighttpd during repair procedure"
        Do NOT select to install Lighttpd when being asked, as this will mix our own webserver stack setup with a different once provided by the Pi-hole installer, which causes various issues.

=== "Setting the password"

    If you forgot your login password for the Pi-hole admin web page, you can set it with the shell command `pihole -a -p` on your Pi-hole device.

=== "Blocklists and whitelists"

    There are many sites in the web giving blocklists and whitelists for Pi-hole. They can be used when you want to have more blocking as the standard installation gives you. Here are some examples:

    - [The Big Blocklist Collection from `WaLLy3K`](https://firebog.net)
    - [Blocklists from Pi-Hole forum](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/update-the-best-blocking-lists-for-the-pi-hole-alternative-dns-servers-2019/13620)
    - [Phishing Army blocklist](https://phishing.army)
    - [`anudeepND` whitelist](https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist)

=== "Accessing via OpenVPN or WireGuard"

    To allow (OpenVPN or WireGuard) VPN clients accessing your local Pi-hole instance, you need to allow DNS requests from all network interfaces: `pihole -a -i local`.

=== "Monitor Pi-hole"

    [DietPi-CloudShell](../system_stats/#dietpi-cloudshell) has a Pi-hole scene included, which can be used to monitor the most important DNS query and block statistics. Simply run `dietpi-cloudshell`, select `Scenes` and assure that `8 Pi-hole` is selected. Toggle `Output Display` to choose whether to print the output to the current console or the main screen, then select `Start / Restart` to start the output.

## Unbound

Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver.  
For more details see [unbound "about" description](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/).

![Unbound monitor screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-software-unbound.jpg){: width="500" height="274" loading="lazy"}

=== "Default DNS ports"

    - Default DNS port: 53
    - DNS port when Pi-hole is installed: 5335

=== "Configuration directory"

    The configuration directory is located there: `/etc/unbound`

=== "View logs"

    View the log files: `journalctl -u unbound`

=== "Updating unbound"

    Update to latest version: `apt update && apt upgrade`

=== "Activating DNS over TLS (DoT)"

    If required, you can activate DoT. Simply copy/execute following section: 
    
    ```
    cat << '_EOF_' > /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/dietpi-dot.conf
    # Adding DNS-over-TLS support 
    server:
    tls-cert-bundle: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
    forward-zone:
    name: "."
    forward-tls-upstream: yes
    ## Cloudflare
    forward-addr: 1.1.1.1@853#cloudflare-dns.com
    forward-addr: 1.0.0.1@853#cloudflare-dns.com
    ## Quad9
    forward-addr: 9.9.9.9@853#dns.quad9.net
    forward-addr: 149.112.112.112@853#dns.quad9.net
    _EOF_
    ```

    Once done, Unbound service would need to be restarted
    
    ```
    systemctl restart unbound
    ```

    The used DNS servers are examples only and can be replaced by your favorite one. A list of public DNS providers, their IP addresses and their in cases included ad blocking / adult content blocking features are available on Wikipedia:
