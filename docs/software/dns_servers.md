## Pi-hole - Network-wide Ad Blocking

Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole with web interface that will block ads for any device on your network.

- Also Installs: [Webserver stack](../webserver_stack/)

### Access the web interface

The web interface of Pi-hole can be accessed via:

- URL= http://<your.IP/domain/admin\>
- Password = <yourGlobalSoftwarePassword\> (default: dietpi)

### Configure devices to use Pi-hole for DNS resolution

#### Option 1 - Setup single devices to use the Pi-hole DNS server

Simply change your DNS settings to use the IP address of your Pi-hole device. This will need to be done for each device that you want Pi-hole to work with.

Example:

- My Pi-hole device has the IP address of 192.168.0.100
- On my PC, I would set the DNS address to 192.168.0.100

#### Option 2 - Setup your router to use the Pi-hole DNS server

This method will automatically point every device (that uses DHCP) on your network to Pi-hole.
On your routers control panel web page, you will need to find a option called "DNS server". This should be located under DHCP settings.

Simply enter the IP address of your Pi-hole device under "DNS server":

On your Pi-hole device, you will need to set a different DNS server.  
Depending on your router configuration, if you don't do this step, the Pi-hole device may not be able to access the internet. It's highly recommended to have the device running Pi-hole, pointing to a DNS server outside your network.

- Run the following command: `dietpi-config 8 1`
- Select: *Ethernet*
- If you are running in DHCP mode, select *Change Mode*, then select: *Copy Current address to Static*
- Select *Static DNS* from the list, then choose a DNS server, or manually enter a custom entry.
- Once completed, select *Apply* to save the changes.

### Further procedures

#### Updating Pi-hole

Pi-hole can be updated via the shell command `pihole -up`.

#### Repairing Pi-hole

You can use `pihole -r` to repair or reconfigure your Pi-hole instance.

!!! warning "No selection of Lighttpd during repair procedure"
    Do NOT select to install Lighttpd when being asked, as this will mix our own webserver stack setup with a different once provided by the Pi-hole installer, which causes various issues.

#### Setting the password for Pi-hole

If you forgot your login password for the Pi-hole admin web page, you can set it with the shell command `pihole -a -p` on your Pi-hole device.

#### Accessing Pi-hole via OpenVPN or WireGuard

To allow (OpenVPN or WireGuard) VPN clients accessing your local Pi-hole instance, you need to allow DNS requests from all network interfaces: `pihole -a -i local`.

## No-IP - Dynamic DNS update client

Use your No-IP account and website URL address to always have it pointing to your DietPi system. Essential if your hosting a website.

![DietPi DNS server software No-IP](../assets/images/dietpi-software-dnsserver-noip.jpg){: style="width:200px"}

The setup of No-IP is done as follows:

- Create your free No-IP account https://www.noip.com/sign-up and select a web address for your account.
- Type `dietpi-config` in a terminal and press enter.
- Go to *Networking Options: Misc* and select *No-IP* from the menu.
    If No-IP is not yet installed, confirm the installation and reselect No-IP from the menu once completed.
- Type in your *username* and *password* details at the prompt.
- Type in *5* for the interval option.

If successful, the No-IP current status will change to: *Online*.  
You will need to enable port forwarding on your router for all programs your require and point them to DietPi. E.g.: TCP port 80/443 for websites, pointing to 192.168.0.100.
