# Usage hints / HowTo

This chapter contains several documents describing the usage of DietPi.

## How to upgrade to Buster

Debian Bullseye has been released on August 14, 2021, and Debian Stretch has become "oldoldstable". Regular support for Debian Stretch ended last year and LTS support will end in 2022. We hence highly recommend to upgrade to the new Debian Bullseye.

If you are fine with flashing a new image, follow the brief instructions on our [blog post](https://dietpi.com/blog/?p=811#2.1-fresh-install) to cover common migration steps.

If too much customisation has been done without having it well documented or scripted, an upgrade of the running system may be easier. Run the below commands step by step to perform the upgrade from Stretch to Buster in a first step. If you face any errors and are unsure how to resolve, please contact us via our [community forum](https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=11) or [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues) to find help.

```sh
dietpi-backup 1
sed -i 's/stretch/buster/g' /etc/apt/sources.list{,.d/*.list}
rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dietpi-php.list
rm -f /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/dietpi-php.gpg
rm -f /etc/apt/preferences.d/dietpi-{php,openssl,xrdp}
rm -f /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/97-dietpi.cnf
/boot/dietpi/func/dietpi-set_software apt-cache clean
apt update
apt upgrade
apt full-upgrade
apt autopurge
/boot/dietpi/func/dietpi-obtain_hw_model
. /boot/dietpi/func/dietpi-globals
```

If you have PHP installed, also run the following commands to prevent issues when installing additional PHP modules:

```bash
mapfile -t packages < <(dpkg --get-selections '*php*' | mawk '$2=="install" {print $1}')
dpkg -r --force-depends "${packages[@]}"
apt -y install "${packages[@]}"
unset -v packages
```

Check if everything is working fine, do a `reboot` and check again. If so, we recommend to continue directly upgrading further to the current stable Debian Bullseye release, following the instructions given in our blog post: <https://dietpi.com/blog/?p=811#2.2-manual-upgrade>

## How to use the logging mechanism

DietPi uses systemd as system and service manager, which includes the `systemd-journald` logging daemon.
An additional syslog daemon, like `rsyslog`, is not required and hence not pre-installed on DietPi. The basic command to access `systemd-journald` logs is

```sh
journalctl [options]
```

<font size="+2">Logging basic output</font>

Using simply `journalctl` prints out all logging messages stored in the system.  
Each line shows:  
<timestamp\> <hostname\> <process name\>[PID]: <log message\>

The following screenshot shows the logging of the boot process (of a DietPi virtual machine). You can see the various fields (timestamp, hostname, etc.) in the log entries:

<font size="+2">Logging output filtering options</font>

Some of the options are described in the following table.  
More detailed options may be studied in the [man pages of `journalctl`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/journalctl.1.html).

| Command | Remark |
| - | - |
| `journalctl -u UNITNAME` <br>(`--unit UNITNAME`) | Displays messages of the given unit |
| `journalctl _PID=<process_id>` | Displays messages of process with PID equals to <process_id\> |
| `journalctl -r` <br>(`--reverse`) | Displays list in reverse order, i.e. newest messages first |
| `journalctl -f` <br>(`--follow`) | Displays the tail of the log message list and shows new entries *live* |
| `journalctl -b` <br>(`--boot`) | Displays messages since the last boot (i.e. no older messages). See also option `--list-boots` |
| `journalctl -k` <br>(`--dmesg`) | Displays kernel messages |
| `journalctl -p PRIORITY` <br>(--priority PRIORITY) | Displays messages with the given priority. PRIORITY may be `merg`, `alert`, `crit`, `err`, `warning`, `notice`, `info` and `debug`. Also numbers as PRIORITY are possible |
| `journalctl -o verbose` | Displays additional meta data |
| `journalctl --disk-usage` | Displays the amount of disk space used by the logging messages |
| `journalctl --no-pager | grep <filter>` | Filters log messages (filtering with `grep`) |

In the software package descriptions, sometimes there is a tab called "View Logs". This gives a `jounalctl -u UNITNAME` command example how to filter the logging messages of a given software package.  
Example: See [tab "View logs"](../software/dns_servers/#unbound) of *Unbound*. It gives: `journalctl -u unbound`.

<font size="+2">Logging options</font>

As described in the chapter [Log system choices](../software/log_system/), DietPi has several options how the logging system operates. Especially the log history, the memory consumption and the frequency of SD card write accesses varies.  
Find and set the options which fit to your demands, it is also an option to change the logging to examine some problems.

| Log option | location | log depth | log persistence |
| - | - | - | - |
| DietPi-RAMlog #1 | RAM | last hour | volatile, i.e. not saved to disk |
| DietPi-RAMlog #2 | RAM | long term | stored, i.e. hourly saved to disk |
| Full logging | disk | long term | stored, i.e. immediately saved to disk <br>(with Rsyslog and Logrotate)|
