??? info "How do I run `dietPi-software` and install **optimised software**?"

    This tool will automatically launch when you first boot your Raspberry Pi using DietPi after the initial configuration process has completed. You can also launch it manually by typing `dietpi-software` in the terminal.

    - To begin, select **Software Optimized** in the main menu list and hit Enter.    
    - Scroll through the list of available software - for more details check [DietPi Optimised Software](../user-optimised_software)
    - To install software on your DietPi, select it in the list and press the **space bar** to add it to the installation list. If you change your mind, hit space again to remove it.
    - Once you’ve selected the software you wish to install, press the tab key on your keyboard to switch to the confirmation options at the bottom. Select **OK**, then hit enter on your keyboard to confirm.
    - To begin installing your software, select **Install** from the main menu list, then hit the Enter key. DietPi will ask you to confirm your choice(s). Select **OK**, then hit enter to begin the installation.

    The software you selected will begin to install at this point.  
    Once the process is completed, you may be asked to restart your device. Press **OK** to confirm.

You can return to the **DietPi-Software** tool to make further changes at any time by typing `dietpi-software` at the terminal, or enter `dietpi-launcher` and select **DietPi-Software** tool.
