## DietPi drive manager

Feature-rich drive management utility. It is a lightweight program that allows you to:

- Manage drives: Mount, format external drives
- Maintenance drives: Check and repair drives, resize (expand) filesystem, change reserved blocks count
- Set drive attributes: Set read only filesystems, set idle spindown time
- Move DietPi User data
- Transfer RootFS to external drive (Raspberry Pi and some ODROID boards only)
- Disable swap file, change swap file size
- Run benchmarks on drives
- Mount network drives (NFS and Samba)

To start DietPi-Drive_Manager, use the following command:

```sh
dietpi-drive_manager
```

![DietPi-Drive_Manager screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-drive-manager.jpg){: width="643" height="327" loading="lazy"}

### Setup a dedicated drive for DietPi

To use an additional drive (example USB drive) the following steps have to be done:

1. Run `dietpi-drive_manager` to bring up the main menu.
1. Plug in the drive you wish to use.
1. Select `Refresh` from the menu (if it doesn't show up straight away, give it a few seconds for system to update, then try again).
1. Select the drive you wish to use from the list, then press ++enter++.

    ![DietPi-Drive_Manager screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-drive-manager_2.png){: width="600" height="297" loading="lazy"}

    If needed, format the drive before usage selecting the `Format` option (filesystem type description see below).  
    Remark: Formatting drives can only be done unmounted.

    If needed, mount the drive via the `Mount` selection. If mounted, commands `Unmount`, `Benchmark`, `User data`, `Swapfile` and `Read only` are present.

    ![DietPi-Drive_Manager screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-drive-manager_3.png){: width="600" height="395" loading="lazy"}

### Move the location of user data and swap file

You can move the location of the DietPi user data (default `/mnt/dietpi_userdata`) or the swap file to a different location on a target drive. This may be useful if your filesystem containing the DietPi user data resp. swap file has only little space left.
Therefore execute the following steps (example user data, swap file is quite similar):

1. Run `dietpi-drive_manager` to bring up the main menu.
1. Have the target drive connected and mounted (see description above).
1. Select the target drive and press ++enter++.
1. In the drives menu select `User data` resp. `Swapfile` and follow the instructions.

- Move user data:

![DietPi-Drive_Manager screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-drive-manager_4.png){: width="500" height="139" loading="lazy"}

- Change swap file size:

![DietPi-Drive_Manager screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-drive-manager_5.png){: width="500" height="188" loading="lazy"}

### Format filesystem types

Formatting filesystems lead you to these dialogues:

![DietPi-Drive_Manager screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-drive-manager_6.png){: width="500" height="137" loading="lazy"}
![DietPi-Drive_Manager screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-drive-manager_7.png){: width="500" height="326" loading="lazy"}

In the latter dialog you have to choose the filesystem type. The following selections may be chosen:

=== "ext4 (Default)"

    Recommended for users who plan to use this drive solely on Linux systems (e.g. dedicated drive).  
    `+` The standard for Linux filesystems  
    `-` Not compatible on a Windows system

=== "NTFS"

    Recommended for users who plan to use this drive on a Windows system.  
    `+` Compatible on a Windows system  
    `-` Only emulated support for UNIX permissions  
    `-` Does support symbolic links (creation)  
    `-` High CPU usage during transfers (spawns a process)

### Move DietPi system to a larger SD card

If you want to extend your DietPi SD card space by moving the system to a larger memory card, this can be achieved by the following steps:

1. Shutdown your system and put the SD card into a card reader of a different systems.
1. Copy the SD card contents to the new (larger) SD card. This can e.g. be done using
    - the `dd` command (command line option)
    - [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.io/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (graphical user interface option)
    - `gnome-disks` (graphical user interface option)
1. Boot the system with the copied memory card.
1. Run `dietpi-drive_manager` to bring up the main menu.
1. Select the disk containing the root (`/`) partition and press ++enter++.
1. Select `Resize` and press ++enter++.

    ![DietPi-Drive_Manager screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-drive-manager_8.png){: width="500" height="138" loading="lazy"}

1. Reboot your system to expand the root filesystem to use the whole space of the new memory card.

A similar procedure may be used when moving the SD card contents to a smaller SD card. During this procedure you typically need to shrink the partition size (e.g. with `parted` or `gparted`) before copying the partition image to a different memory card. Also, do the resize to use the full space on the new card.

### Mount network drive

If you want to mount a NFS drive or a Samba share, you can do this by:

1. Run `dietpi-drive_manager` to bring up the main menu.
1. Select `Add network drive`.
1. Select the type of network drive that you have.
1. Follow the prompts.

!!! info "Mounting a macOS Samba share"
    To mount a macOS Samba share enabled in `Sharing`, you need to (in the server) go to `Sharing > File Sharing > Options > Windows File Sharing` and select your username.

## DietPi survey

DietPi Survey allows the DietPi project to obtain general information regarding your system and installed software. To start DietPi-Survey, use the following command:

```sh
dietpi-survey
```

???+ important "Privacy and goals"

    The following privacy rules and goals are considered:

    - No private data is sent. No one can identify you. No IP address is obtained.
    - DietPi Survey is an ***Opt-in*** system, which means that it won't send any data without your explicit interactive permission.
    - On your first interactive login on a fresh DietPi system, you will be asked once for the *Opt-in*/*Opt-out* mode.
    - The transmitted data allows the DietPi project team to achieve the best future possible experience for everyone to
        - focus and improve especially popular areas,
        - ensure the most common devices and software titles will receive support and improvements,
        - keep up support for software and hardware that you use.

    **In short words:** By selecting ***Opt IN***, you are supporting the DietPi project with no impact to your system or private data.

![DietPi Survey screenshot](../assets/images/dietpi-survey.jpg){: width="645" height="368" loading="lazy"}

=== "Data transmission events"

    The DietPi Survey data file is sent when you install software with `dietpi-software` and update DietPi with `dietpi-update`.

=== "Uploaded amount of data"

    The uploaded data is tiny (about 1 KB) and will not affect your internet bandwidth or system performance.

=== "Transmitted data contents"

    Within the command line program `dietpi-survey` the exact copy of the transmitted data can be viewed. The transmitted file is written in bash code to allow us faster report page creation (e.g. done for <https://dietpi.com/survey>).

    Following is an example how this file may look like:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    ((aDIETPI_VERSION[6.34]++))
    ((aGIT_BRANCH[MichaIng/master]++))
    ((aDEVICE_NAME[Virtual Machine (x86_64)]++))
    ((aCPU_ARCH[x86_64]++))
    ((aCPU_COUNT[2]++))
    ((aDISTRO_VERSION[buster]++))
    ((aAUTOSTART_OPTION[${aAUTOSTART_NAME[0]:=0}]++))
    ((aAUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED[0]++))
    ((aNETWORK_INTERFACE[eth0]++))
    # -------------------------
    # DietPi-Software installs
    # -------------------------
    ((aSOFTWARE[${aSOFTWARE_NAME6_34[103]:=103}]++))
    ((aSOFTWARE[${aSOFTWARE_NAME6_34[104]:=104}]++))
    ```

    The tail of the file lists installed software packages by their IDs. The example above shows a very basic system, so only two software packages (`#103`: DietPi-RAMlog, `#104`: Dropbear) are installed.
    To find out the names of the installed software package IDs installed via `dietpi-software` you can execute

    ```sh
    dietpi-software list | grep ' =2'
    ```

    This gives the IDs, names and info of software. The above example would show

    ```text
    # dietpi-software list | grep ' =2'
    id 103 | =2 | dietpi-ramlog: minimal, optimised logging | | https://dietpi.com/docs/software/log_system/#dietpi-ramlog
    id 104 | =2 | dropbear: lightweight ssh server | | https://dietpi.com/docs/software/ssh/#dropbear
    ```

=== "Selecting Opt-in or Opt-out"

    You can select ***Opt-in*** or ***Opt-out*** of DietPi Survey by running the following command and follow the instructions:

    ```sh
    dietpi-survey
    ```

    This may also be achieved by setting `SURVEY_OPTED_IN=0` (*Opt-out*) or `SURVEY_OPTED_IN=1` (*Opt-in*) in `/boot/dietpi.txt` before the first system boot.

    To check the actual status, `dietpi-survey` may be called. The current mode will be pre-selected and highlighted.  
    Alternatively you can use

    ```sh
    grep 'SURVEY_OPTED_IN' /boot/dietpi.txt
    ```

    which displays the status like

    ```text
    # grep 'SURVEY_OPTED_IN' /boot/dietpi.txt
    SURVEY_OPTED_IN=1
    ```
