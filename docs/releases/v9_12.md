### New software

- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**fish**](../software/system_software.md#fish) :octicons-arrow-right-16: A dietpi-software entry for this alternative shell has been added. Aside of installing the fish APT package, a DietPi-specific config script is added to enable dietpi-* aliases and load the `dietpi-login` script for first run setup and autostart options. Many thanks to @ndrew222 for implementing this software option: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7452>

### Enhancements

- **General** :octicons-arrow-right-16: DietPi scripts will now call `sensible-editor` instead of `nano` for opening text files in a command-line text editor. This makes also use of the `update-alternatives` feature, will usually prefer e.g. Vim if installed, and may allow interactive selection of one of the installed editors, if multiple are available. Many thanks to @Keating950 for implementing this enhancement: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7474>
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Backup**](../dietpi_tools/system_maintenance/#dietpi-backup-backuprestore.md#dietpi-backup-backuprestore) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Support for writing a backup into an SSHFS has been added.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Amiberry**](../software/gaming.md#amiberry) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Our packages have been updated to Amiberry v7. Additionally, recommended for ARM and RISC-V SBCs slower than Raspberry Pi 4, Amiberry-Lite has been implemented as dedicated software option. Since APT upgrades from Amiberry v5 to v7 automatically, a backup of the old config/data directory will be created, and in case used as initial config/data directory for Amiberry-Lite. Hence if Amiberry v7 does not run well on your platform, you can install Amiberry-Lite, starting with the previous v5 setup. Some more details about the two variants can be found here: <https://github.com/BlitterStudio/amiberry/wiki/First-Installation#which-version-should-i-pick>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**WiringPi**](../software/hardware_projects.md#wiringpi) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Added support for Orange Pi boards, using the `wiringOP` sources from Xunlong: <https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/wiringOP>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Spotifyd**](../software/media.md#spotifyd) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Added support for ARMv8 and x86_64 Bookworm/Trixie systems, supported with the latest Spotifyd release.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**RPi.GPIO**](../software/hardware_projects.md#rpigpio) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Since the modern Raspberry Pi kernel removed support for the legacy GPIO API, `python3-rpi-lgpio` will now be installed instead, providing an RPi.GPIO compatibility layer for the modern `lgpio` library.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Pi-hole**](../software/dns_servers.md#pi-hole) :octicons-arrow-right-16: By default, instances installed via `dietpi-software` will additionally listen on TCP port 8489 for HTTPS requests. It is one of the Pi-hole v6 core features users might expect enabled by default. It uses a self-signed TLS certificate by default, hence browsers will show a warning until it is replaced by a TLS certificate from by a trusted public certificate authority.

### Bug fixes

- [**DietPi-Config**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-config) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where enabling the `waveshare32` LCD panel failed on Raspberry Pi with new kernel/firmware stack. Many thanks to @guiksign for fixing this bug: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7462>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**O!MPD**](../software/media.md#ompd) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where changing the `config.php` from within the web UI and storing covers did not work due to missing permissions. Many thanks to [@praveensg](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/praveensg) for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/22993>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**FreshRSS**](../software/social.md#freshrss) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the website did not work properly on Bullseye systems, since FreshRSS v1.25.0 and later requires PHP 8.1+. On those systems, the latest v1.24.3 will be installed instead. Many thanks to [@kaferenza](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/kaferenza) for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/23129>

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7480>
