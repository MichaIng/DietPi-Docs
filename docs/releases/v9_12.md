### New software

- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**fish**](../software/system_software.md#fish) :octicons-arrow-right-16: A dietpi-software entry for this alternative shell has been added. Aside of installing the fish APT package, a DietPi-specific config script is added to enable dietpi-* aliases and load the `dietpi-login` script for first run setup and autostart options. Many thanks to @ndrew222 for implementing this software option: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7452>

### Enhancements

- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Backup**](../dietpi_tools/system_maintenance/#dietpi-backup-backuprestore.md#dietpi-backup-backuprestore) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Support for writing a backup into an SSHFS has been added.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**WiringPi**](../software/hardware_projects.md#wiringpi) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Added support for Orange Pi boards, using the `wiringOP` sources from Xunlong: <https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/wiringOP>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Spotifyd**](../software/media.md#spotifyd) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Added support for ARMv8 and x86_64 Bookworm/Trixie systems, supported with the latest Spotifyd release.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**RPi.GPIO**](../software/hardware_projects.md#rpigpio) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Since the modern Raspberry Pi kernel removed support for the legacy GPIO API, `python3-rpi-lgpio` will now be installed instead, providing an RPi.GPIO compatibility layer for the modern `lgpio` library.

### Bug fixes

- [**DietPi-Config**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-config) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where enabling the `waveshare32` LCD panel failed on Raspberry Pi with new kernel/firmware stack.
