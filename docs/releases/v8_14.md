### New images

- [**Orange Pi 5**](../../hardware/#orange-pi-series) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Support for Orange Pi 5 SBC has been added to DietPi with hardware ID 80.
- [**Odroid N2/C4/HC4**](../../hardware/#odroid) :octicons-arrow-right-16: New images have been generated with support for the default Hardkernel SPI bootloader petitboot. Thanks to this, boot from USB devices is now possible, and on Odroid HC4 it is not necessary anymore to erase the SPI flash or flash mainline U-Boot to it. Many thanks to @hstarcm and @Power-onoff for bringing up this topic and help testing adjustments to the boot script: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5634>
- [**ROCK 5B**](../../hardware/#radxa) :octicons-arrow-right-16: New images with ext4 boot filesystem have been generated, to solve possible issues and limitations of the previously used FAT filesystem. Many thanks to @isarrider for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6122>

### Improvements

- [**NanoPi R2S/NEO3**](../../hardware/#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Video related kernel modules are now blacklisted on these headless SBCs, saving some bits of RAM and load at boot.
- [**DietPi-Config**](../../dietpi_tools/system_configuration/#dietpi-config) :octicons-arrow-right-16: It is now possible to change the `dietpi.txt` network connection test settings `CONFIG_CHECK_CONNECTION_IP`, `CONFIG_CHECK_CONNECTION_IPV6` and `CONFIG_CHECK_DNS_DOMAIN` via `dietpi-config` -> `Network Options` -> `Misc menu`. Those are used when checking Internet access via IPv4 and IPv6 and DNS resolver functionality.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Gogs**](../../software/cloud/#gogs) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Our ARMv6 build for Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero (1) models has been updated to latest version 0.12.10. The update can be applied via reinstall: `dietpi-software reinstall 49`
- **DietPi-Globals** :octicons-arrow-right-16: G_CHECK_NET: When hitting "Retry" from the error handler, the IPv6 connection check is now skipped as well when IPv6 is disabled via `dietpi-config` network settings or manually. The same is true for changes to the `CONFIG_CHECK_CONNECTION/DOMAIN` `dietpi.txt` settings, which can now also be changed right from the error handler. Many thanks to @derSebastian for reporting a related issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5667>

- [**ROCK Pi 4**](../../hardware/#radxa) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where onboard WiFi on ROCK Pi 4C Plus did not work, and potentially other variants than ROCK Pi 4B. Many thanks to @Marco for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/rock4c-no-wifi-hardware-found/15654>
- [**DietPi-Drive_Manager**](../../dietpi_tools/system_configuration/#dietpi-drive-manager) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where KVM VirtIO virtual disk volumes were not handled correctly.

- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Docker**](../../software/programming/#docker) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved a v8.13 regression where Docker dependants (Portainer, Roon Extension Manager) failed to install as the Docker socket was not activated. Many thanks to @omavoss for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6065>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**ownCloud**](../../software/cloud/#owncloud)/[**Nextcloud**](../../software/cloud/#nextcloud) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where a global software password with dashes lead to a failing install.

- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**X.Org X Server**](../../software/desktop/#desktop-environments-utilities) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the install failed on ARM VMs with KMS support, where the `xserver-xorg-video-vmware` package was tried to be installed. Many thanks to @mews-se for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6085>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Amiberry**](../../software/gaming/#amiberry) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where using keyboard LEDs as power/activity indicators did not work, and stopping the service could hang. You can apply the fix by reinstalling Amiberry via `dietpi-software reinstall 108`. Many thanks to @DJP75 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5536>

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6053>
