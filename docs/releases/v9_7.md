### Enhancements

- [**Odroid N2**](../hardware.md#odroid) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Added an option to update (flash) the SPI bootloader to the dietpi-config "Advanced Options" menu.
- [**RK3588 SoCs**](../hardware.md) :octicons-arrow-right-16: This DietPi update offers a migration from the legacy Linux 5.10 kernel to "vendor" Linux 6.1 kernel, from newer and cleaner Rockchip kernel sources. Aside of new kernel features, it provides cleaner higher quality code, so we generally recommend the upgrade. However, we do not enforce it, and it makes sense to have a backup in place, and you can do the migration any time later.
- [**DietPi-Banner**](../dietpi_tools/misc_tools.md/#dietpi-banner) :octicons-arrow-right-16: An option has been added to show the CPU load as common 1/5/15 minutes averages. Many thanks to @rkok for implementing this feature: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7186>
