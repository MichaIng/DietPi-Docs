### New images

- **StarFive VisionFive 2** :octicons-arrow-right-16: An experimental image has been added. For details, please read our related blog post: <https://dietpi.com/blog/?p=2629>
- [**Quartz64**](../../hardware/#pine64) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Major kernel update to latest v6.1.14, stable U-Boot v2022.04 and enabled a lot of kernel features for various container engines and firewall/filter tasks: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6151>. The kernel upgrade will be applied on DietPi update.

### Improvements

- [**DietPi-Installer**](../../hardware/#make-your-own-distribution) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where conflicting network configurations were left in place, e.g. from `cloud-init` when running the script on a VPS Debian image. Many thanks to @mews-se for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6067>
- [**DietPi-CPU_info**](../../dietpi_tools/misc_tools/#dietpi-cpu-info) :octicons-arrow-right-16: The script and `cpu` command do not require root privileges anymore. Many thanks to @hansratzinger for bringing this to our attention: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6196>. The option to write available scaling frequencies to a file via command argument "2" has been removed as well. This was not documented anywhere and has no use for end users. Internally it was used by `dietpi-config`, where the code has now been moved to and overall shortened.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**XRDP**](../../software/remote_desktop/#xrdp) :octicons-arrow-right-16: TLS via snakeoil certificate is now enabled OOTB. This leads to a warning shown on Windows RDP clients until either a proper certificate signed by a trusted CA is used (e.g. by Let's Encrypt), or it is muted for the particular server via checkbox at the client. Many thanks to @amibumping for providing the needed step: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5976>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Home Assistant**](../../software/home_automation/#home-assistant) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Our Home Assistant integration used two Python environments: A pyenv is used to install the `homeassistant` core module and its direct dependencies. Home Assistant itself installs its frontend with dependencies on startup, as well as dependencies for integrations on demand, internally into another Python environment. On Home Assistant reinstalls, pyenv is removed but the internal dependencies were left untouched. This caused issues when those dependency builds were incompatible with the new pyenv Python version, or conflicting with other pyenv module upgrades.  
Both environments are now merged and reset on every reinstall, which solves potential conflicts but means that the first Home Assistant startup after a reinstall takes longer. Many thanks to @maury77 for reporting a related issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6117>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**WiFi Hotspot**](../../software/advanced_networking/#wifi-hotspot) :octicons-arrow-right-16: hostapd and the DHCP server are not stopped and restarted on DietPi updates, software installs and backups anymore, since the hotspot might be used by the client which does this task and then cuts its own connection. Many thanks to @symbios24 for making us aware of this: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6166>

### Bug fixes

- [**Quartz64**](../../hardware/#pine64) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the system boots read-only on very first boot. Many thanks to @belveder79 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6149>
- [**DietPi-Sync**](../../dietpi_tools/system_maintenance/#dietpi-sync) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the prompt after the dry run was shown even in non-interactive mode (input argument "1"), and when selecting `Cancel` or `ESC`, the real sync ran regardless. Many thanks to @Ruud for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/howto-call-dietpi-sync-1-without-user-interaction/15964>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Docker Compose**](../../software/programming/#docker-compose) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where installing and uninstalling Docker Compose could have failed if pip was installed without the `distutils` module. Many thanks to @bccarbone for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6153>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Pi-hole**](../../software/dns_servers/#pi-hole) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where Nginx, if chosen as webserver, failed to start due to an invalid variable. Many thanks to @Trimble-tech for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/pi-hole-install-crashes-nginx/15960>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Python 3**](../../software/programming/#python-3) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the install failed because pip started to deny system-wide package installs without passing a new flag.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Synapse**](../../software/social/#synapse) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the install failed on Debian Bookworm.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/xxxx>
