### New software

- [**Prowlarr**](../../software/bittorrent/#prowlarr) :octicons-arrow-right-16: The indexer manager of the Servarr family has been added as dietpi-software option.

### Improvements

- **Security** :octicons-arrow-right-16: It is now possible to enter the WPA-PSK WiFi key as 64-digit hexadecimal key, as e.g. returned by `wpa_passphrase`. It will be converted as needed, stored and applied to `wpa_supplicant` config automatically in this format. In case of using `dietpi-wifi.txt` on a fresh DietPi installation, please note that this requires an image with DietPi v8.5 pre-installed, i.e. dated after May 28, 2022. Many thanks to @robinemde for doing this suggestion: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5406>
- **Security** :octicons-arrow-right-16: It is now possible to add public SSH keys to `dietpi-wifi.txt`, to be applied at first boot for public key authentication with "dietpi" and "root" users. Additionally, SSH password authentication can be disabled for all users or "root" only. Have a look at `AUTO_SETUP_SSH_PUBKEY` and `SOFTWARE_DISABLE_SSH_PASSWORD_LOGINS` settings in `/boot/dietpi.txt`.
- **DietPi-Software** | [**Dropbear/OpenSSH**](../../software/ssh/) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Password authentication is now disabled if set via `SOFTWARE_DISABLE_SSH_PASSWORD_LOGINS` setting in `/boot/dietpi.txt`.
- **DietPi-Software** | [**Amiberry**](../../software/gaming/#amiberry) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Updated to latest version 5.2 and shipped now as DEB package. Also the included `libSDL2` libraries have been updated to latest stable versions. Additionally builds for all SBCs and architectures, including x86_64, have been added, i.e. Amiberry is now available on all platforms.
- **DietPi-Software** | [**WiringPi**](../../software/hardware_projects/#wiringpi) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Build dependencies have been reduced so that only the actually required tools and headers are installed instead of the whole Build-Essential package.

### Bug Fixes

- [**DietPi-VPN**](../../dietpi_tools/#dietpi-vpn) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where applying a ProtonVPN connection or starting the killswitch could have failed, if the `gettext-base` package was not installed. Many thanks to @Wilford888 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5501>
- **DietPi-Software** | [**Spotifyd**](../../software/media/#spotifyd) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where fresh installs failed because of a missing parent directory. Many thanks to @C0ntroller for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5484>
- **DietPi-Software** | [**WiringPi**](../../software/hardware_projects/#wiringpi) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the install on Odroids failed as of a change in the build scripts of Hardkernel's fork. Many thanks to @MDAR for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5485>
- **DietPi-Software** | [**Gitea**](../../software/cloud/#gitea) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the service failed to start after a reinstall when Gitea was installed before DietPi v7.9. Many thanks to @twikedk for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5516>
