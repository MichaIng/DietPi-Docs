### New software

### Improvements

- **DietPi-Software** | [**Amiberry**](../../software/gaming/#amiberry) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Updated to latest version 5.1 and shipped now as DEB package. Also the included libSDL2 libraries have been updated to latest stable versions. Additionally builds for all SBCs and architectures, including x86_64, have been added, i.e. Amiberry is now available on all platforms.
- **DietPi-Software** | [**WiringPi**](../../software/hardware_projects/#wiringpi) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Build dependencies have been reduced so that only the actually required tools and headers are installed instead of the whole Build-Essential package.
