### Enhancements

- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**NoMachine**](../software/remote_desktop.md#nomachine) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Our install option will now always download the latest NoMachine version, instead of a hardcoded one depending on the DietPi version. Many thanks to @tzvi208 for for figuring it out to version-agnostic download URLs: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7198>

Many thanks to @oldboys92 for implementing this enhancement: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7217>

### Bug fixes

- [**NanoPi M3/T3**](../hardware.md#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where our recent image did not boot because the bootloader did not define a default device tree path anymore. Many thanks to @rozcietrzewiacz for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2630#issuecomment-2322085507>
- [**NanoPi R5S/R5C**](../hardware.md#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the Ethernet LEDs did not work on systems upgraded from the legacy Linux 5.10 kernel. Many thanks to @innovodev for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/21026>
- [**ROCK 4**](../hardware.md#radxa) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where a false APT component was applied for your APT server, leading to errors and missing kernel/firmware upgrades. Many thanks to @cdlenfert for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/20771>
