### New images

- [**NanoPC T6**](../hardware.md#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Our NanoPi R6S/R6C image runs as well on the new NanoPC T6. After some polishing, we merged the hardware IDs to be identified and named as "NanoPi 6 series".

### New software

- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**MediaWiki**](../software/social.md#mediawiki) :octicons-arrow-right-16: The collaboration and documentation platform which was developed for and is used by Wikipedia has been added to our software catalogue.

### Removed software

- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | **Spotify Connect Web** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Development of this Spotify player stalled already in 2018, the underlying library has been deprecated even before that time. The process fails on Debian Bookworm and we have the functional alternatives [**Raspotify**](../software/media.md#raspotify) and [**Spotifyd**](../software/media.md#spotifyd): <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6418>.  
If you need to uninstall this software title after the DietPi update, have a look here: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6427>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | **Firefox Sync Server** :octicons-arrow-right-16: As much as we like the browser and the idea of self-hosting its data sync, it stopped working already on Debian Bullseye, as it requires Python 2, which is EOL since 2020. Work has started on a new token server (one component of the whole stack) written in Rust, but it has been archived again. A sync storage server written in Rust exists, however, we are not able to compose a whole stack in Rust, respectively one that natively runs on modern OS versions. If someone is able to get a whole Firefox Sync Server up without Python 2, we would love to re-add it to our software catalogue.

### Enhancements

- **General** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Initial detection and support for Debian 13 Trixie (the new "testing" version) has been added to DietPi. Everyone is invited to upgrade to Trixie to stay on bleeding edge. Just note that due to continued breaking changes coming with package upgrades, some features and software installs may break at any time. We are happy to receive your bug report then, to have necessary changes implemented in DietPi as fast as breaking changes in Trixie happen, until it becomes the new stable Debian release, expected in summer 2025.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**microblog.pub**](../software/social.md#microblogpub) :octicons-arrow-right-16: On fresh installs and reinstalls, the pyenv Python version will be raised to 3.11.4, matching the version of the official Docker container.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Home Assistant**](../software/home_automation.md#home-assistant) :octicons-arrow-right-16: The `pyenv` Python version has been updated to 3.11.4 to maintain compatibility with Home Assistant and align with Home Assistant OS and containers. Many thanks to @whyisthisbroken and others for informing us about this: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/home-assistant-finally-integrates-python-3-11/17033>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**ympd**](../software/media.md#ympd) :octicons-arrow-right-16: We migrated to own DEB packages based on `SuperBFG7's` `ympd` fork and enabled the installation option on Debian Bookworm and RISC-V systems. The update will be automatically applied for existing `ympd` installs as part of the DietPi update.

### Bug fixes

- [**Quartz64**](../hardware.md#pine64) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where some iptables/nftables features did not work as of missing kernel features. Many thanks to @acelinkio for reporting the issue and pointing us at the solution: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6389>
- **Allwinner H3 SBCs** :octicons-arrow-right-16: The analogue 3.5mm audio jack can now be enabled as intended via dietpi-config audio options. As it is done via kernel device tree overlay, a reboot is required when switching to or from analogue audio. Many thanks to @eurya and others for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6093>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Bazarr**](../software/bittorrent.md#bazarr) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue on Bookworm ARMv6/7 systems where the install failed because of missing dependencies.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**microblog.pub**](../software/social.md#microblogpub) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the install failed on x86_64 due to a missing new build dependency.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Home Assistant**](../software/home_automation.md#home-assistant) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Since compiling the `ha-av` Python module for latest Home Assistant requires more recent FFmpeg libraries than provided on Debian Bullseye, sadly it now requires at least Debian Bookworm to install Home Assistant on ARMv6, ARMv7 and RISC-V hardware. Existing Home Assistant instances will remain functional, but on affected systems one cannot update/reinstall it until upgrading to Debian Bookworm: <https://community.home-assistant.io/t/unable-to-install-package-ha-av/466286/39>, <https://dietpi.com/blog/?p=3128>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Java JRE**](../software/programming.md#java) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Worked around an issue on Bullseye systems where the JRE package install fails with an error which is gone when just retrying it.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6445>
