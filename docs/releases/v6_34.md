### Changes / Improvements / Optimisations

- **Enable automated APT package update checks and even upgrade them on a daily bases**. By setting the new `dietpi.txt` setting

    ```sh
    CONFIG_CHECK_APT_UPDATES=1
    ```

    you can enable daily APT update checks (default value). The result is shown in the DietPi login banner, in a similar way an available DietPi update is presented.

    dietpi-automated_APT_package_update
    ![dietpi Automated APT packages update](../assets/images/dietpi-automated_APT_package_update.jpg){: width="670" height="326" loading="lazy"}

    Set

    ```sh
    CONFIG_CHECK_APT_UPDATES=2
    ```

    to have _APT packages upgraded automatically_ on a daily basis with logs saved in next file `/var/tmp/dietpi/logs/dietpi-update_apt.log`. Cron is used for the schedule, which means that you can control the execution time via `dietpi-cron > "cron.daily"`.

    Many thanks to @ravenclaw900 for implementing this feature: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3899>

- **DietPi Documentation** has been extended. It covers now all the **[DietPi Optimised Software](../../software/)** categories. Many thanks to @StephanStS for bringing all these updates.

    ![DietPi Documentation](../assets/images/dietpi-docs-categories.jpg){: width="1335" height="667" loading="lazy"}

- **DietPi-Globals** :octicons-arrow-right-16: In DietPi scripts, the PATH variable is now overwritten with the Debian/bash system default to assure that no broken or manipulated PATH can be passed via e.g. `su` or `sudo -E`. This means that overrides must be placed in `/usr/local/(s)bin` now, which as well was the only save location for system-wide overrides before. Many thanks to @tandy-1000 for reporting a related issue (MichaIng/DietPi!3873).
- **DietPi-Set_swapfile** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Hardened permissions of the `/dev/zram0` zram-swap device to be only accessible by root user (mode 0600) and interpret input argument `/dev/zram0` and `zram0` as `zram-swap` as well, aside of `zram` only. Many thanks to @hansjuergenmay for reporting a related issue (MichaIng/DietPi!3869).
- **DietPi-NordVPN** :octicons-arrow-right-16: A function has been added update the NordVPN server list, e.g. when new servers are available that are closer to your location.
- **[DietPi-JustBoom](../../dietpi_tools/#configuration)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: The ALSA equalizer settings are not stored to `/var/lib/dietpi/dietpi-config/.alsaequal.bin` where all users/services can read it and all members of the `dietpi` group (or `root`) can create and write to it. Many thanks to @wowcut for reporting this issue (MichaIng/DietPi!3950).
- **[DietPi-Config | Raspberry Pi](../../dietpi_tools/#display-options)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: When applying less than 32 MiB GPU memory, the VCSM (VideoCore Shared Memory) device and kernel module are disabled now. The automatically loaded cut-down firmware files do not support it which leads to currently 5 expected kernel error messages. Disabling it in the first place might marginally speed up boot and reduce memory usage, but more importantly reduces confusion or worries induced by to the error messages.
- **[DietPi-Config | Audio Options](../../dietpi_tools/#audio-options)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Added an option to switch between direct audio output and automatic software conversions, for channels, format and rate via ALSA "plug" plugin. This may be required to play any raw `.wav` file regardless of sound card capabilities and without defining supported values manually. Having automated software conversions enabled matches the Debian ALSA defaults but may increase CPU usage and decrease sound quality.
- **[DietPi-Config | Raspberry Pi](../../dietpi_tools/#advanced-options)**: When enabling I2C support, the Python 3 SMbus module is now installed instead of the deprecated Python 2 version. This matches as well the dependency of PiJuice, which nowadays pulls Python 3 SMbus as package dependency, hence this change avoids the obsolete install of the whole Python 2 stack when PiJuice is installed through dietpi-software. Many thanks to @Trunkzeh for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3963#issuecomment-748547394>
- **[DietPi-Software | OpenBazaar](../../software/social/#openbazaar)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Build is now done with the currently latest Go v1.15.3 and the service runs as unprivileged user `openbazaar` instead of `root`.
- **[DietPi-Software | XRDP](../../software/remote_desktop/#xrdp)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Remote desktop connections can now be done with the `Xorg` method and hence don't require an active VNC server anymore. New installations will not pull TigerVNC as dependency and if only RDP is required, TigerVNC can be uninstalled.
- **[DietPi-Software | Single File PHP Gallery](../../software/social/#image-gallery)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Updated new installs to latest v4.7.1. Run `dietpi-software reinstall 56` to upgrade your existing instance.
- **[DietPi-Software | MineOS](../../software/gaming/#mineos)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: A systemd service is now used to run the daemon in favour of the previous supervisor, the obsolete `mineos` user is not created anymore, Node.js v11 is used to build MineOS, obsolete dependencies have been removed and a reinstall will now perform a MineOS upgrade and the existing `/etc/mineos.conf` is not replaced anymore.
- **[DietPi-Software | Mycroft AI](../../software/hardware_projects/#mycroft-ai)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: By default, the ALSA automatic conversions plugin is enabled now on install, which enables OOTB compatibility with all `.wav` sound formats and sound card. Additionally listener sampling rate override (48000 Hz) has been removed, reverting to Mycroft default (16000 Hz), which might solve an issue with hanging microphone level in CLI and related failing voice detection.
- **[DietPi-Software | Gogs](../../software/cloud/#gogs)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Has been enabled for ARMv8 boards and on ARMv7 boards the newest version is installed again, which was not the case since Gogs v0.12. due to changed download names. Many thanks to [phpBB:MadKernel](https://dietpi.com/phpbb/memberlist.php?username=MadKernel){: class="nospellcheck"} for bringing ARMv8 support back to our attention: <https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=8276>
- **[DietPi-Software | Folding@Home](../../software/distributed_projects/#foldinghome)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Is now available for ARMv8 (arm64) boards. Donate your idle CPU power to help researchers fighting against diseases like Cancer, Alzheimer, Ebola and COVID-19.
- **[DietPi-Software | Radarr](../../software/bittorrent/#radarr)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Has been upgraded to the newest major version 3, including the required branch migration (from "develop" to "master") and, for non-ARMv6 boards, a migration to the now available .NET-based build away from Mono. This change is applied to all DietPi systems via Radarr reinstall, preserving your data and configs of course.
- **[DietPi-Software | OctoPrint](../../software/printing/#octoprint)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Is now available via PyPI repository, hence can be installed and updated easier and faster without downloading and building from the sources. Git is not required anymore, as the internal updater as well uses Python pip only. We migrate all DietPi OctoPrint instances to the new version and new install method, so that the Git/install directory `/opt/octoprint` is obsolete and removed. All your data will be preserved, of course. Many thanks to @Stinocon for reporting issues related to our previous implementation: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3940>

### Removed Software Packages

- **DietPi-Software** | **CloudPrint** :octicons-arrow-right-16: This software option has been removed, since the Google Cloud Print service will be shut down at the end of 2020 and we don't want to offer software options which will work for at most two months. Please migrate to another printing solution in time. Already installed CloudPrint instances will remain installed and the system service remains functional until the end of the year. With the first DietPi release in 2021 we will remove service handling and offer the package removal during the update process. Further information can be found here: <https://www.google.com/cloudprint/learn/>
- **DietPi-Software** | **Tonido** :octicons-arrow-right-16: This software option has been removed, since it is not developed anymore fore three years, no sources have been found and the latest binaries require ancient library versions which fail to be easily installed on currently supported Debian versions.

### Bug Fixes

- **[DietPi-Config](../../dietpi_tools/#configuration)** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue on RPi where the onboard 3.5mm jack selection did not work if an HDMI screen was attached. When selecting explicit either HDMI audio or onboard 3.5mm jack, the other one is now disabled on device tree level, which means it cannot be switched without reboot. This is currently the only known way to assure that 3.5mm jack is used for audio output regardless of now or later attached or detached HDMI screens.
