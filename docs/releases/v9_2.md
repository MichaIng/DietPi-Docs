### Enhancements

- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) :octicons-arrow-right-16: It is now possible to run `dietpi-software list` concurrent to other dietpi-software instances, and as non-root user. This avoids an issue in DietPi-Dashboard, where opening dietpi-software in the Terminal and switching to the Software page, caused an infinite hang.

### Bug fixes

- [**NanoPi R4S**](../hardware.md#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where Ethernet adapter of the "LAN" port could disappear after a soft reboot. Many thanks to @idaanx for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6342>
- **DietPi-Globals** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where a concurrent DietPi script detection could have prevented the start of a script, if a previous instance was killed via SIGKILL.
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Config**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-config) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where a WiFi connection, configured for the first time via dietpi-config from a local terminal session, was automatically stopped when exiting or logging out from the terminal session.


- DietPi-Software | PaperMC: Resolved an issue where installing the Geyser and Floodgate plugins failed due to changed download URLs, and a false syntax in the Geyser config file. Many thanks to @boterocamilo for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6898

Many thanks to @howardroark for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/forum/t/nextcloud-theme-broken-after-upgrade-v9-1-1/19372
- DietPi-Software | Home Assistant: Resolved an issue on x86_64 and ARMv8 systems where some core integrations did not work if no C++ compiler was installed. If you are affected by this, "apt install g++ && systemctl restart home-assistant" will fix it. Many thanks to @pdsakurai for fixing this issue in our install code: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6931
- DietPi-Software | DarkIce: Resolved an issue where the service failed to start due to false config file permissions.

- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Backup**](../dietpi_tools/system_maintenance.md#dietpi-backup-backuprestore)/[**DietPi-Sync**](../dietpi_tools/system_maintenance.md#dietpi-sync) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Both scripts do now only error out when the `rsync` process is already running, rather than on any process which has the term `rsync` in its name.

- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Domoticz**](../software/home_automation.md#domoticz) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Enabled for x86_64 Bookworm and Trixie systems, since the latest x86_64 builds were compiled against `libssl3`.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**vaultwarden**](../software/cloud.md#vaultwarden) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Along with a regular update, RISC-V support has been added.

Many thanks to [@naddel91](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/naddel91){: class="nospellcheck"} and others for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/increase-partition-size/19015>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Mosquitto**](../software/hardware_projects.md#mosquitto) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the global software password was accidentally applied as username instead of as password: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6886>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Amiberry**](../software/gaming.md#amiberry) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on 64-bit RPi systems. Many thanks to @JerichoCross for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6893>

However, Pydio 8 is not maintained since years, does not support PHP 8 and hence can only work on Bullseye systems. We will migrate to Pydio Cells, once someone finds time to work on this: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3469>

With multiple Squeezelite players, this could have lead to conflicts among them. Many thanks to [@willefg](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/willefg){: class="nospellcheck"} for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/dietpi-squeezelite-players-with-same-mac-address-000000-00/19312>
