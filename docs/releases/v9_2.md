### Enhancements

- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) :octicons-arrow-right-16: It is now possible to run `dietpi-software list` concurrent to other dietpi-software instances, and as non-root user. This avoids an issue in DietPi-Dashboard, where opening dietpi-software in the Terminal and switching to the Software page, caused an infinite hang.

### Bug fixes

- [**NanoPi R4S**](../hardware.md#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where Ethernet adapter of the "LAN" port could disappear after a soft reboot. Many thanks to @idaanx for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6342>
- **DietPi-Globals** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where a concurrent DietPi script detection could have prevented the start of a script, if a previous instance was killed via SIGKILL.
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Config**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-config) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where a WiFi connection, configured for the first time via dietpi-config from a local terminal session, was automatically stopped when exiting or logging out from the terminal session.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**PaperMC**](../software/gaming.md#papermc) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where installing the Geyser and Floodgate plugins failed due to changed download URLs, and a false syntax in the Geyser config file.
