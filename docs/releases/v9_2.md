### Enhancements

- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Banner**](../dietpi_tools/misc_tools.md#dietpi-banner) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Support for showing the current RAM usage was added. Many thanks to @Andr3Carvalh0 for the implementation: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6844>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) :octicons-arrow-right-16: It is now possible to run `dietpi-software list` concurrent to other dietpi-software instances, and as non-root user. This avoids an issue in DietPi-Dashboard, where opening dietpi-software in the Terminal and switching to the Software page, caused an infinite hang.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Gogs**](../software/cloud.md#gogs)/[**Gitea**](../software/cloud.md#gitea) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Using repositories via SSH should now work OOTB with new installs and reinstalls. If pull or push operations via SSH fail in your case, try to give the respective user a default shell: `sudo usermod -s /bin/dash gogs` respectively `sudo usermod -s /bin/dash gitea`. This is now included in our default setup. Many thanks to @din14970 for reporting this missing feature: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/6964#discussioncomment-8813390>

### Bug fixes

- [**NanoPi R4S**](../hardware.md#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where Ethernet adapter of the "LAN" port could disappear after a soft reboot. Many thanks to @idaanx for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6342>
- **DietPi-Globals** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where a concurrent DietPi script detection could have prevented the start of a script, if a previous instance was killed via `SIGKILL`.
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Config**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-config) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where a WiFi connection, configured for the first time via dietpi-config from a local terminal session, was automatically stopped when exiting or logging out from the terminal session.
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Config**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-config) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue on RPi systems, where HDMI audio did not work if full KMS was enabled. The firmware/bcm2835 HDMI audio driver conflicts with the full KMS display driver, hence the VC4 HDMI driver needs to be used instead. That one however only supports the IEC958 audio format, which requires a complex ALSA config. This config is shipped with the `libasound2-data` package of the RPi APT repository, but it was overwritten by our `/etc/asound.conf`. For HDMI audio to work with KMS, the `default` or `sysdefault` ALSA PCM needs to be used by players. This is usually the case, but some allow to select a specific sound card, in which case the ALSA config and plugin for IEC958 conversion is bypassed, breaking HDMI audio. Many thanks to [@Lollly2997](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/Lollly2997){: class="nospellcheck"} for reporting this issue. We are working with Amiberry on a solution for Amiberry in particular. This fix is for the underlying system level: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/19568>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**PaperMC**](../software/gaming.md#papermc) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where installing the Geyser and Floodgate plugins failed due to changed download URLs, and a false syntax in the Geyser config file. Many thanks to @boterocamilo for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6898>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Nextcloud**](../software/cloud.md#nextcloud) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue with the updated Nginx config where assets were served with the wrong MIME type. This fix was backported to v9.1 and a live patch offered. Many thanks to [@howardroark](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/howardroark){: class="nospellcheck"} for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/nextcloud-theme-broken-after-upgrade-v9-1-1/19372>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Home Assistant**](../software/home_automation.md#home-assistant) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue on x86_64 and ARMv8 systems where some core integrations did not work if no C++ compiler was installed. If you are affected by this, `apt install g++ && systemctl restart home-assistant` will fix it.
