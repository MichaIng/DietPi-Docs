### New images

- [**Orange Pi 5 Plus**](../hardware.md#orange-pi-series) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Support for the Orange Pi 5 Plus SBC has been added to DietPi with hardware ID 82. Images will be provided on our download page: <https://dietpi.com/#download>

### Enhancements

- [**Orange Pi 5**](../hardware.md#orange-pi-series), [**ROCK 5B**](../hardware.md#radxa) :octicons-arrow-right-16: An update of the kernel to Linux 5.10.160 will be applied automatically as part of the DietPi update.
- [**Orange Pi 5**](../hardware.md#orange-pi-series) :octicons-arrow-right-16: An update of the U-Boot package will be applied. When flashing it to SPI via `dietpi-config` > "Advanced Options" > "Update SPI bootloader", it enables booting DietPi via NVMe and USB.
- **RK33xx SBCs** :octicons-arrow-right-16: All SBCs with RK33xx SoC and Armbian's `linux-image-current-rockchip64` kernel package will receive a major kernel upgrade to Linux 6.1.46, including lots of fixes and enhancements that have been applied upstream and by Armbian in the meantime. Since Armbian's APT repository has not seen any update since February 2023, we started compiling and hosting own builds. An own APT repository is being worked on to better distribute our own package builds.
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Config**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-config) | [**WiFi HotSpot**](../software/advanced_networking.md#wifi-hotspot) :octicons-arrow-right-16: When applying settings, manually changed IP addresses in `/etc/network/interfaces` will now be preserved. Additionally, it is now assured that changing interface names, e.g. due to an additionally attached WiFi adapter, are now aligned across `/etc/network/interfaces`, hostapd and DHCP server configs.
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Config**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-config) | [**WiFi HotSpot**](../software/advanced_networking.md#wifi-hotspot) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Toggles for enabling 802.11ac/WiFi 5, 802.11ax/WiFi 6 (Bookworm only) and 5 GHz WiFi respectively have been added to the menu.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**WiFi HotSpot**](../software/advanced_networking.md#wifi-hotspot) :octicons-arrow-right-16: We added new `dietpi.txt` settings `SOFTWARE_WIFI_HOTSPOT_WIFI4`, `SOFTWARE_WIFI_HOTSPOT_WIFI5`, `SOFTWARE_WIFI_HOTSPOT_WIFI6` and `SOFTWARE_WIFI_HOTSPOT_5G` to have 802.11n/WiFi 4, 802.11ac/WiFi 5, 802.11ax/WiFi 6 (Bookworm only) and 5 GHz support respectively enabled on install.

### Bug fixes

- **DietPi-Globals** | **G_GET_NET** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the default route was not detected correctly if learned via OSPF or other routing protocols which change the output field numbers of the `ip route` command. Many thanks to @owendelong for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6561>
- [**DietPi-Installer**](../hardware.md#make-your-own-distribution) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where building images for ARMv7 hardware was not possible on a ARMv8 host. Offered/accepted ARM hardware IDs are now based on the userland/OS architecture of the image instead of the CPU/kernel architecture returned via `uname -m`. Many thanks to @dirkhh for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/6541>
- **DietPi-Set_swapfile** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue on Bookworm systems where zram swap space was not enabled automatically on boot due to missing `syscall` permissions, and the swappiness was not changed as intended. Many thanks to @magicfoxt-magicfox for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6511>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**DietPi-LetsEncrypt**](../software/system_security.md#lets-encrypt) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved a v8.20 regression where Lighttpd did not start after applying or renewing the certificate due to a syntax error. Many thanks to @JappeHallunken for fixing this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6517>

Defaults are now applied in this case. Many thanks to @huettenwirt for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/ifup-error-due-to-faulty-etc-network-interfaces/17605>
