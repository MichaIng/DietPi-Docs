### SBC/hardware support

- [**NanoPi R5S**](../../hardware/#nanopi-series-friendlyarm) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Initial support for FriendlyELEC's new router SBC has been added, with three Ethernet ports, up to 2.5 Gbit/s, based on the new Rockchip RK3568 SoC.

### New software

- **DietPi-Software** | [**Readarr**](../../software/bittorrent/#readarr) :octicons-arrow-right-16: The ebook manager of the Servarr family has been added as dietpi-software option.
- **DietPi-Software** | [**Navidrome**](../../software/media/#navidrome) :octicons-arrow-right-16: An open source web-based music collection server and streamer has been added as dietpi-software option.

### Improvements

- **DietPi-Software** | [**Prowlarr**](../../software/bittorrent/#prowlarr) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Logging is now done to `/var/log/prowlarr` as intended. For this change to take effect, existing instances need to be reinstalled once: `dietpi-software reinstall 151`
- **DietPi-Software** | [**vaultwarden**](../../software/cloud/#vaultwarden) :octicons-arrow-right-16: DEB packages are now hosted on dietpi.com, replacing the time consuming in-place compiling. This also solves issues where builds failed due to insufficient memory.

### Bug Fixes

- **DietPi-Software** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where `cgroup_enable=memory` was unnecessarily added multiple times on Raspberry Pi when installing or reinstalling container engines. Many thanks to @mdsjip for fixing this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5600>
