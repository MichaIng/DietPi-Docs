### Enhancements

- **General** :octicons-arrow-right-16: We added an own APT repository at <https://dietpi.com/apt/> for own software and kernel/firmware builds. This simplifies updates for software packages like [Squeezelite](../software/media.md#squeezelite), [vaultwarden](../software/cloud.md#vaultwarden) and [Amiberry](../software/gaming.md#amiberry), and allows us to provide own up-to-date kernel and bootloader packages, applied via regular `apt upgrade`. A goal is also to become independent of some 3rd party repositories, which are regularly affected by network errors or provide package updates too infrequently.
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Config**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-config) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Removed the 3.5mm audio option on Raspberry Pi 5, as it does not have a 3.5mm jack. Additionally, the KMS graphics driver is enabled OOTB when HDMI audio is selected, as the `snd_bcm2835` driver does not work on Raspberry Pi 5. Many thanks to [@denguido](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/denguido){: class="nospellcheck"} for making us aware of this: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/19760>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Mosquitto**](../software/hardware_projects.md#mosquitto) :octicons-arrow-right-16: The official APT repository added support for 64-bit ARM on Bookworm, which is now used for our installation.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | **UnRAR** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Debian added `unrar` packages for RISC-V, which are now used for our installation.

### Bug fixes

- [**Raspberry Pi 5**](../hardware.md#raspberry-pi) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Fixed X11/desktop startup if KMS is enabled. Many thanks to [@denguido](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/denguido){: class="nospellcheck"} for reporting the issue and solution: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/19760>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Logitech Media Server**](../software/media.md#logitech-media-server) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the install failed due to a changed download URL. Many thanks to @JRK0469 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6992>
