### New images

- [**All images**](../../hardware/) :octicons-arrow-right-16: DietPi images are now shipped with a trailing FAT partition which contains `dietpi.txt` and other config files for easier pre-configuration and automation from Windows and macOS hosts. The partition is removed automatically on first boot, after copying all supported config files/scripts. Related CLI flags have been added to our build scripts: `--add-fat-part` for `dietpi-imager` and `--no-fat-part` for `dietpi-build`. Many thanks to @dirkhh for implementing this feature: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6602>
- [**All images**](../../hardware/) :octicons-arrow-right-16: All our images are now compressed via `xz` instead of `7z`. These are a little easier to handle, especially on Linux hosts, and many flashing utilities allow to flash xz-compressed images directly to disk, without the need to manually decompress them first. As `xz` compresses files and no directories, the dedicated `README.md` and hash text files are not included anymore. The hashes for integrity checks within an archive have no real purpose, as the compression algorithms imply hashes internally (CRC64 in case of `xz`), which are checked and integrity of the content checked as part of the decompression.

### New software

- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**ADS-B Feeder**](../../software/distributed_projects/#ads-b-feeder) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Track airplanes using SDRs and feed the data to ADS-B aggregators. Many thanks to @dirkhh for maintaining and implementing this software option: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6587>

### Enhancements

- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Docker**](../../software/programming/#docker) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Enabled for Trixie and RISC-V via `docker.io` package from Debian repository.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Portainer**](../../software/programming/#portainer) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Enabled for RISC-V as Docker is now supported on RISC-V as well.

### Bug fixes

- [**NanoPi R4S**](../../hardware/#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved a v8.20 regression where the Ethernet LEDs did not react correctly after the kernel upgrade. Many thanks to @idaanx for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6342#issuecomment-1697669420>
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../../dietpi_tools/) | [**DietPi-Config**](../../dietpi_tools/system_configuration/#dietpi-config) :octicons-arrow-right-16: The menu option to update the SPI bootloader is now shown on Orange Pi 5 Plus as well, as intended. Many thanks for @zappydood for reporting its absence: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6501#issuecomment-1697175109>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Ampache**](../../software/media/#ampache) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the latest version was not successfully detected on install, so that an older fallback version was installed instead. Many thanks to @bartolus39 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6598>

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6580>
