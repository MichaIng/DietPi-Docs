### New software

- **xxx** :octicons-arrow-right-16: yyy.

### SBC/hardware support

- **NanoPi M2/T2/Fire2** :octicons-arrow-right-16: We updated our NanoPi 2 series image to be shipped with Linux 4.4, the latest Linux version for the S5P4418 SoC, provided by FriendlyELEC. It is compatible will all **FriendlyELEC S5P4418 SBCs**: *NanoPi 2, NanoPi M2, NanoPC T2, NanoPi Fire2A, NanoPi 2 Fire and NanoPi S2*.  
Sadly systems running the old image **cannot be upgraded**, since the new U-Boot requires more space and hence a different partitioning.  
The new image ships with two scripts to flash U-Boot and to change the U-Boot environment/config: One can now edit `/boot/u-boot/env.txt` and apply the changes by running `/boot/u-boot/flash_env.sh`. Run `fw_printenv` to see the current U-Boot environment, also to get an idea of available settings.
