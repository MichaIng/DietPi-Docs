### New software

- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**openHAB**](../../software/social/#openhab) :octicons-arrow-right-16: This long requested vendor and technology agnostic FLOSS home automation software has been finally added to DietPi. Many thanks to @just-jason and many others for requesting it and @MDAR for providing install instructions and valuable information: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3857>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | **Moonlight** :octicons-arrow-right-16: This game streaming client for Sunshine and NVIDIA GameStream has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @mtekman for implementing it: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6303>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | **Moonlight Qt** :octicons-arrow-right-16: This GUI game streaming client for Sunshine and NVIDIA GameStream has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @mtekman for implementing it: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6339>

### Enhancements

- [**NanoPi R series**](../../hardware/#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Updated udev rules for the Ethernet LEDs to not lid the LEDs of disabled Ethernet devices. If an Ethernet device has been detected by the kernel/udev already and an LED is configured to light on link (connected cable), it lights until the interface is set up and no link is detected. So for disabled interfaces, some LEDs remained lit. The udev rules have now been changed to quickly set up and down the interfaces for the LEDs to remain off until an interface has been successfully configured.
- [**NanoPi R6S**](../../hardware/#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Since our image runs fine on NanoPi R6C as well, the device name in DietPi is now shown as "NanoPi R6S/R6C" to indicate this fact.
- [**ROCK Pi 4**](../../hardware/#radxa) :octicons-arrow-right-16: We followed Radxa and renamed the device to "ROCK 4", i.e. removed the "Pi" from its name.
- [**DietPi-Banner**](../../dietpi_tools/misc_tools/#dietpi-banner) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Added a new option to show the Let's Encrypt certificate status (expiry date), when installed via `dietpi-letsencrypt` or Certbot. Many thanks to @gary2002 for implementing this option: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6314>
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../../dietpi_tools/) | [**DietPi-LetsEncrypt**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-letsencrypt) :octicons-arrow-right-16: HTTP/2 is now enabled OOTB on Nginx when enabling HTTPS via `dietpi-letsencrypt`. Many thanks to @Isti6github for bringing up this topic: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/nextcloud-memories-http-2-or-http-3-is-strongly-recommended-http-1-1-detected-nginx/16753>

- [**Raspberry Pi**](../../hardware/#raspberry-pi) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where enabling the 3.5mm analogue onboard audio jack did not work if a HDMI device was attached, since due to a change with Linux 6.1 HDMI audio was not disabled correctly. Many thanks to @Gale for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/no-audio-from-rpi-4b-headphone-jack/16538>
- [**Quartz64**](../../hardware/#pine64) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the kernel failed to load the WiFi regulatory database since the cfg80211 module was builtin and hence loaded before the rootfs was mounted.
- **DietPi-Globals** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved a DietPi v8.16 regression where wrong CPU temperatures were shown on some devices. Many thanks to @duledxb for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6315>

The issue occurred since the 64-bit kernel is used on RPi 4 by default since Linux 6.1, even if the OS/userland is 32-bit. Many thanks to @josh3003 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6306>
