### New software

- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**openHAB**](../../software/social/#openhab) :octicons-arrow-right-16: This long requested vendor and technology agnostic FLOSS home automation software has been finally added to DietPi. Many thanks to @just-jason and many others for requesting it and @MDAR for providing install instructions and valuable information: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3857>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | **Moonlight** :octicons-arrow-right-16: This game streaming client for Sunshine and NVIDIA GameStream has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @mtekman for implementing it: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6303>

### Enhancements

- [**NanoPi R series**](../../hardware/#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Updated udev rules for the Ethernet LEDs to not lid the LEDs of disabled Ethernet devices. If an Ethernet device has been detected by the kernel/udev already and an LED is configured to light on link (connected cable), it lights until the interface is set up and no link is detected. So for disabled interfaces, some LEDs remained lit. The udev rules have now been changed to quickly set up and down the interfaces for the LEDs to remain off until an interface has been successfully configured.
- [**NanoPi R6S**](../../hardware/#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Since our image runs fine on NanoPi R6C as well, the device name in DietPi is now shown as "NanoPi R6S/R6C" to indicate this fact.
- [**ROCK Pi 4**](../../hardware/#radxa) :octicons-arrow-right-16: We followed Radxa and renamed the device to "ROCK 4", i.e. removed the "Pi" from its name.
- [**DietPi-Banner**](../../dietpi_tools/misc_tools/#dietpi-banner) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Added a new option to show the Let's Encrypt certificate status (expiry date), when installed via dietpi-letsencrypt or Certbot. Many thanks to @gary2002 for implementing this option: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6314>
