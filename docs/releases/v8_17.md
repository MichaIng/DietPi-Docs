### New software

- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**openHAB**](../software/social.md#openhab) :octicons-arrow-right-16: This long requested vendor and technology agnostic FLOSS home automation software has been finally added to DietPi. Many thanks to @just-jason and many others for requesting it and @MDAR for providing install instructions and valuable information: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3857>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Moonlight (CLI)**](../software/gaming.md#moonlight-cli) :octicons-arrow-right-16: This CLI game streaming client for Sunshine and NVIDIA GameStream has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @mtekman for implementing it: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6303>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Moonlight (GUI)**](../software/gaming.md#moonlight-gui) :octicons-arrow-right-16: This GUI game streaming client for Sunshine and NVIDIA GameStream has been added to our software catalogue. Many thanks to @mtekman for implementing it: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6339>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Restic**](../software/cloud.md#restic) :octicons-arrow-right-16: This fast, efficient and secure command-line backup program has been added to our software catalogue.

### Enhancements

- [**NanoPi R series**](../hardware.md#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Updated udev rules for the Ethernet LEDs to not lid the LEDs of disabled Ethernet devices. If an Ethernet device has been detected by the kernel/udev already and an LED is configured to light on link (connected cable), it lights until the interface is set up and no link is detected. So for disabled interfaces, some LEDs remained lit. The udev rules have now been changed to quickly set up and down the interfaces for the LEDs to remain off until an interface has been successfully configured.
- [**NanoPi R6S**](../hardware.md#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Since our image runs fine on NanoPi R6C as well, the device name in DietPi is now shown as "NanoPi R6S/R6C" to indicate this fact.
- [**ROCK Pi 4**](../hardware.md#radxa) :octicons-arrow-right-16: We followed Radxa and renamed the device to "ROCK 4", i.e. removed the "Pi" from its name.
- [**DietPi-Banner**](../dietpi_tools/misc_tools.md#dietpi-banner) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Added a new option to show the Let's Encrypt certificate status (expiry date), when installed via `dietpi-letsencrypt` or Certbot. Many thanks to @gary2002 for implementing this option: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6314>
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-LetsEncrypt**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-letsencrypt) :octicons-arrow-right-16: HTTP/2 is now enabled OOTB on Nginx when enabling HTTPS via `dietpi-letsencrypt`. Many thanks to [@Isti6github](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/Isti6github){: class="nospellcheck"} for bringing up this topic: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/nextcloud-memories-http-2-or-http-3-is-strongly-recommended-http-1-1-detected-nginx/16753>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**MinIO**](../software/cloud.md#minio) :octicons-arrow-right-16: On fresh installs, the S3 API port will be 9004 from now on, to resolve a port conflict with Logitech Media Server. Furthermore the web access port (aka console port) will be set to 9001, as otherwise it will be randomly applied from a high port range, making reverse proxy and container setups impossible. Many thanks to [@din14970](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/din14970){: class="nospellcheck"} for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/configuring-https-for-minio-through-nginx/16775>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Snapcast**](../software/media.md#snapcast-server) :octicons-arrow-right-16: The server and client install options have been enabled on ARMv8 and RISC-V, using the older but functional packages from the Debian repository.

- [**Raspberry Pi**](../hardware.md#raspberry-pi) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where enabling the 3.5mm analogue onboard audio jack did not work if a HDMI device was attached, since due to a change with Linux 6.1 HDMI audio was not disabled correctly.
