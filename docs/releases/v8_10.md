### Bug Fixes

- Raspberry Pi | Resolved an issue where some I2C and SPI device drivers were not loaded. Many thanks to @f-laurens and others for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5789>
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where it was not possible to disable the swap file with less than 2 GiB available free space on that drive. The check was meant to prevent the creation of a swap file with limited free space, while disabling/removing a swap file should of course always be possible. Furthermore the 2 GiB free space requirement has been removed completely, which has no point on non-system drives and is too strict even on system drives which, depending on the setup, can run fine with much less free space. Many thanks to @symbios24 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5749#issuecomment-1257169750>
- DietPi-Software | FreshRSS: Resolved an issue where the install failed because of changed branches on the GitHub repository. Many thanks to @baptiste313 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/5767>
- DietPi-Software | Roon Bridge: Resolved an issue where the internal updater failed because of insufficient permissions. Many thanks to @Tristan_Harward for reporting this issue: <https://community.roonlabs.com/t/roon-bridge-on-dietpi-impossible-to-update-from-build-164-to-167-resolved-by-dan-knight-dietpi-creator/52303/80>

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/5760>
