- [**ASUS Tinker Board 2**](../hardware.md#asus-tinker-board) :octicons-arrow-right-16: We added support for this RK3399 SBC from ASUS to DietPi and images to our download page.
- [**Orange Pi Zero 3**](../hardware.md#orange-pi-series) :octicons-arrow-right-16: We added support for this Allwinner H618 SBC to DietPi and images for testing: <https://dietpi.com/downloads/images/testing/>. Note that there is currently an issue with the Ethernet adapter being lost on reboots, requiring a power cycle to re-appear: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6594>

### Enhancements

- [**ROCK 3A**](../hardware.md#radxa) :octicons-arrow-right-16: A kernel upgrade from `edge-rk35xx` (Linux 6.1.11) to `current-rockchip64` (Linux 6.1.50 at time of writing) will be applied, which solves e.g. missing 3.5mm audio output. Many thanks to @wahono77 for testing the kernel upgrade: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6710>
- [**Quartz64**](../hardware.md#pine64) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Along with the regular kernel upgrade, we added support for no-UI HID devices. Many thanks to `@stormwyrm` for the request: <https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?pid=120632>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**openHAB**](../software/home_automation.md#openhab) :octicons-arrow-right-16: The openHAB APT repository will be migrated from testing to stable suite. Previously "testing" was used, as "stable" shipped openHAB 3, which does not support Java 17. In the meantime "stable" ships openHAB 4 as well. Many thanks to @twikedk for bringing this back to our attention: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6731>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Prometheus Node Exporter**](../software/system_stats.md#prometheus-node-exporter) :octicons-arrow-right-16: This software option has been enabled for the RISC-V architecture, for which builds are now available via official GitHub releases.

### Bug fixes

- [**Raspberry Pi 4**](../hardware.md#raspberry-pi) | Worked around an issue on Bookworm systems, where the upgrade of the `rpi-eeprom` package pulled an incompatible `raspi-firmware` package, causing a failure of any APT upgrade. Many thanks to @piyushaswani55 and others for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6747>
- [**Proxmox**](../hardware.md#proxmox) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the QEMU guest agent was not always installed automatically on first boot.
- **DietPi-Globals** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved a v8.22 regression where the error handler and bug report template contained only the first line of the failed command's output.
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved and issue where auto setup failed in case of trailing (non-integer) characters behind the `AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1` `dietpi.txt` setting. In this case, an automatic login was performed, but `dietpi-software` ran in interactive mode. It has been align now so that any trailing characters are ignored and either autologin and automated setup happens both or none. Many thanks to @inis17 for reporting a related issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6719>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Sonarr**](../software/bittorrent.md#sonarr) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved a DietPi v8.23 regression where the install failed at an URL check for the APT key. Many thanks to @TheGitGuy00 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6699>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**NFS Server**](../software/file_servers.md#nfs) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved a DietPi v8.23 regression where the install failed because of a syntax error. Many thanks to @supertevran for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6722>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Shairport Sync**](../software/media.md#shairport-sync) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the install failed because of a missing service user required for the new NQPTP version. Many thanks to @vishnusure for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6735>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**Nextcloud**](../software/cloud.md#nextcloud) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where, with Lighttpd webserver, a warning about missing `ocm-provider` rewrite was shown in some cases. Many thanks to [@rubinski](https://dietpi.com/forum/u/rubinski){: class="nospellcheck"} for reporting this issue: <https://dietpi.com/forum/t/nextcloud-update-error-message-nextcloud-ocm-provider/18266>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**NZBGet**](../software/bittorrent.md#nzbget) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the log file `/var/log/nzbget.log` was not created and used as intended, since the service does not have permissions to create it.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6760>
