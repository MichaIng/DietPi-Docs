### New hardware

- [**NanoPi NanoPi R3S/R3S LTS/R76S/M5**](../hardware.md#nanopi-series-friendlyelec) :octicons-arrow-right-16: New supported SBCs from FriendlyELEC.

### New software

- **LazyLibrarian** :octicons-arrow-right-16: This ebook and audio book collection manager has been added to our software catalogue. It can server as a replacement for Readarr, which is not developed anymore. Many thanks to @JappeHallunken for implementing this software option: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7747>

### Enhancements

- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**DietPi-Dashboard**](../software/system_stats.md#dietpi-dashboard) :octicons-arrow-right-16: A reworked version of the dashboard has been implemented, with better default security, fixed and more flexible frontend/backend node handling and maintainability. The look&feel and features are mostly the same, but under the hood a lot has changed. For now, on reinstall, the old dashboard is disabled but not removed, so one can switch by disabling the new services and enabling the old one. TLS is now enabled by default with auto-generated self-signed certificates. Frontend and backend are two dedicated services. Backends connect at port 5353 by default, while the web UI is accessible at port 5252 by default, like before. While security is generally better, the rework has not been battle-tested thoroughly, hence the general recommendations for such kind of admin interfaces apply especially in this case: Do not open any of the two ports to the Internet directly, use a firewall if there is no router/NAT in between, and use a VPN if remote access is required for some reason. Many thanks to @ravenclaw900 for the huge efforts of this major rework: <https://github.com/ravenclaw900/DietPi-Dashboard/pull/1100>
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Drive_Manager**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-drive-manager) / **DietPi-FS_partition_resize** :octicons-arrow-right-16: Support for Xen virtual block devices has been added, which follow the scheme `/dev/xvd[a-z][1-9]`. Many thanks to @jr551 for implementing this compatibility enhancement: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7755>
- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-Config**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-config) :octicons-arrow-right-16: The SPI bootloader update option and method has been made more generic, to be shown whenever the installed U-Boot package provides a related function and any SPI storage device node exists. The function call has been adjusted to not fail if the function supports both: flashing via `mtd-utils`/`flashcp` to `/dev/mtd0` as well as flashing via `dd` to the block device node `/dev/mtdblock0`. In some cases, the wrong device node was passed to the function. Many thanks to @mlanner for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7761>

### Bug fixes

- [**DietPi-Tools**](../dietpi_tools.md) | [**DietPi-AutoStart**](../dietpi_tools/system_configuration.md#dietpi-autostart) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Fixed a typo which prevents KMS/DRM from being enabled on Raspberry Pi Trixie systems if a LightDM-based autostart option is selected: LightDM login mask or automatic desktop login as non-root user. Many thanks to @TheRaven500 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7644#issuecomment-3329753442>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../dietpi_tools/software_installation.md#dietpi-software) | [**GMediaRender**](../software/media.md#gmediarender) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue on Debian Trixie and Forky images where the package from Debian was installed instead of our own, since there was an upstream release we missed, which changed the version string only. Many thanks to @eevan78 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/7767>

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/7774>
