### Enhancements

- [**Quartz64**](../../hardware/#pine64) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Enabled (software) RAID and Logical Volume Manager (LVM) support. Many thanks to @dano6 for implementing this: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6370>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**youtube-dl**](../../software/bittorrent/#youtube-dl) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Since the development of the original `youtube-dl` project stalled for some years, we migrated to the well known actively developed fork `yt-dlp`: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp>.  
  If you installed `youtube-dl` before, you can migrate via reinstall: `dietpi-software reinstall 195`. For backwards compatibility, the `youtube-dl` command will stay valid as a symlink to `yt-dlp`, but there are some differences you should be aware about when doing the migration on your system: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#differences-in-default-behavior>. Many thanks to @rgabbo for suggestion and @pulpe for implementing this change: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/5670>, <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6380>
