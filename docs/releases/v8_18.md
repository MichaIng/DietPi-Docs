### Enhancements

- [**Quartz64**](../../hardware/#pine64) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Enabled (software) RAID and Logical Volume Manager (LVM) support. Many thanks to @dano6 for implementing this: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6370>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**youtube-dl**](../../software/bittorrent/#youtube-dl) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Since the development of the original `youtube-dl` project stalled for some years, we migrated to the well known actively developed fork `yt-dlp`: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp>  
  If you installed `youtube-dl` before, you can migrate via reinstall: `dietpi-software reinstall 195`. For backwards compatibility, the `youtube-dl` command will stay valid as a symlink to `yt-dlp`, but there are some differences you should be aware about when doing the migration on your system: <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#differences-in-default-behavior>. Many thanks to @rgabbo for suggestion and @pulpe for implementing this change: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/discussions/5670>, <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6380>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Pi-hole**](../../software/dns_servers/#pi-hole) :octicons-arrow-right-16: With recent release, Pi-hole supports RISC-V and has been hence enabled for this architecture as well in DietPi. Many thanks to the Pi-hole team for making this possible to quickly!

### Bug fixes

- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Restic**](../../software/cloud/#restic) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where Restic was installed without executable flag. Many thanks to @lima1 for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6350#issuecomment-1537656560>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**Domoticz**](../../software/home_automation/#domoticz) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the installation failed when trying to unpack the tarball. Many thanks to @mcnahum for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6369>

Many thanks to @IgrekLg for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6404>
- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**motionEye**](../../software/camera/#motioneye) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue where the installation failed on ARMv6, ARMv7 and RISC-V Bookworm systems due to missing build dependencies. Many thanks to @magicfoxt-magicfox for reporting this issue: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/6333>

- [**DietPi-Software**](../../dietpi_tools/software_installation/#dietpi-software) | [**TigerVNC**](../../software/remote_desktop/#tigervnc-server) :octicons-arrow-right-16: Resolved an issue on Bookworm systems where the VNC password was not set as expected since the `tigervncpasswd` command became a dedicated DEB package `tigervnc-tools`.

The official APT repository does not provide a Bookworm suite yet, and the Bullseye packages have Bullseye-only dependencies. On Bookworm the Debian repo packages will be installed instead now.

As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here. Check out all code changes of this release on GitHub: <https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/6406>
