## Native PC & Virtual Machines

### Native PC images

The Native PC images are great for those occasions where SBC performance just isn't enough. Run one of these on any x86_64 PC/server and still get the same great DietPi features and experience. This image is for motherboards with UEFI boot support and onboard eMMC (e.g.: Z83-II, Beelink AP32 and other Intel NUC/SBC devices with onboard eMMC).

### VMware

![VMware logo](assets/images/VMwareESXi_01.jpg){: width="200" height="45" loading="lazy"}

The VMware virtual machine (e.g. [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html/), [VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/content/vmware/vmware-published-sites/us/products/workstation-pro.html/), [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html/)) is great for those occasions where SBC performance just isn't enough. Run one of these on any x86_64 PC/server (Windows, Linux, macOS) and still get the same great DietPi features and experience.

The [VMware ESXi Hypervisor](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html/), described as a "Bare Metal Hypervisor" aka [Type-1 hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor), is part of e.g. the [VMware vSphere Hypervisor platform](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor.html/) ("appliance server"). It allows to run and manage multiple virtual machines on one x86_64 machine. That way it can be compared to the [Proxmox](#proxmox) appliance server.

### VirtualBox

![Oracle VirtualBox logo](assets/images/vbox.jpg){: width="100" height="103" loading="lazy"}

VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualiser for x86 hardware, targeted at server, desktop and embedded use.

The VirtualBox virtual machine is great for those occasions where SBC performance just isn't enough. Run one of these on any x86_64 PC/server and still get the same great DietPi features and experience.

### Proxmox

![Proxmox logo](assets/images/proxmox-logo.svg){: width="400" height="65" loading="lazy"}

[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) is a virtual machine and container platform, based on [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/). It allows to run and manage multiple virtual machines and containers on a Linux OS via CLI and web interface, similar to how VMware's vSphere and ESXi works.

### Parallels

![Parallels Desktop](assets/images/Parallels3.png){: width="270" height="82" loading="lazy"}

The [Parallels Desktop virtual machine](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) is great for those occasions where SBC performance just isn't enough. Run one of these e.g. on any x86_64 macOS system (e.g. Mac mini 2011/2012/2014/2018) and still get the same great DietPi features and experience.

### UTM

![UTM](assets/images/UTM4.png){: width="80" height="80" loading="lazy"}

The [UTM virtual machine](https://mac.getutm.app/) is great for those occasions where SBC performance just isn't enough. Run one of these on any macOS system (e.g. Mac mini 2011/2012/2014/2018 and M1 Apple Silicon) and still get the same great DietPi features and experience.

![UTM](assets/images/UTM3.png){: width="270" height="221" loading="lazy"}

!!! info "Emulation feature of UTM"
    The emulation feature is an option of the virtualization technique to run x86 code on a M1 Mac system and vice versa an M1 Mac code on a x86 Mac system.  
    This might be a good choice e.g. for testing purposes, but typically there will be a performance drawback using the emulation instead of running native x86 images on a x86 system resp. native `aarch64` images on an M1 system.

### Hyper-V

The Hyper-V virtual machine is great for those occasions where SBC performance just isn't enough. Run one of these on any x86_64 PC/server and still get the same great DietPi features and experience.

## Make your own distribution

Unable to find an available image for your device?  
Don't worry, DietPi contains a script which can be used to turn an installed Debian-based OS into DietPi.

!!! attention "Advanced Linux knowledge required"
    To generate your own SBC support, an advanced Linux knowledge is required.  
    There is no guarantee that this will work for every system. Use the DietPi image generation script at your own risk!

!!! info "Limited end user support"
    End user support will be limited to issues that are DietPi specific (which excludes Kernel, GPU, onboard Bluetooth, WiFi, Audio, etc. from our support). GPU features are disabled for other devices (e.g.: Kodi, Desktop), ideal for server usage.  
    Generally in case of troubles it may be necessary that you search the root cause of problems by your own due to non existent SBCs at the DietPi team.

!!! tip "Use an extra SD card to test the DietPi image generation"
    It may be a good idea not to use your "productive and working SD card" to execute the DietPi image generation script.  
    You should use an own SD card and may copy it before via the `dd` command to a SD card for your tests.

### Basic information

The image generation is based on a shell script [`dietpi-installer`](https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/blob/master/.build/images/dietpi-installer):

- **The script will** convert any 'bloated' Debian/Raspbian installation into a lightweight DietPi system.  
- **The script will NOT** support converting existing installed software (e.g. Nextcloud, Plex Media Server) over to the DietPi system.
- **All existing software (APT) and user data will be deleted.**

The script has to be executed on the running target system which you want to convert to a lightweight DietPi system, or when booting the original image as a container.

### Prerequisites

**Requirement 1:** Ensure a Debian/Raspbian OS is running on the system:

- For best results, we recommend a fresh/clean minimal Debian/Raspbian installation.
- Native PC users: Please install Debian stable before hand: <https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst>
- Desktop images should work, however, the minimal the image, the quicker the installation, as less packages will need to be removed.  
  Remark: We do not support Ubuntu, or have any plans to do so.

**Requirement 2:** Packages which have to be installed in advance:

- Needed packages should already exist on most systems, however pure minimal images may require the following installations:

    ```sh
    apt update
    apt install -y curl ca-certificates systemd-sysv
    ```

### Script execution

!!! important "Needed: Run script within SSH command or local term"
    Do not run the script within any desktop environment, because the desktop is uninstalled during the script execution.  
    That will "pull the ground from under your feet".

!!! important "Needed: Root rights"
    Ensure you have elevated privileges (e.g.: login as `root`, or use `sudo`).

Execute the following shell command to download and execute the script:

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaIng/DietPi/master/.build/images/dietpi-installer')"
```

In the following dialog you have to select the DietPi installer branch. Generally use `master` as long as you do not want to create a development image:

![DietPi-Installer branch selection](assets/images/dietpi-prep-selectbranch.png){: width="550" height="266" loading="lazy"}

In the following dialogues enter your name and afterwards the actual image base and the device (SBC or PC) the system is running on:

![DietPi-Installer pre-image entry](assets/images/dietpi-prep-preimage.png){: width="550" height="218" loading="lazy"}

![DietPi-Installer device selection](assets/images/dietpi-prep-deviceselection.png){: width="550" height="290" loading="lazy"}

Depending on whether you want to use the WiFi feature later on, you have to select the option to keep or purge the WiFi package. To keep the package could be the case if your hardware has an onboard WiFi or you add the WiFi e.g. via an USB WiFi adapter.

![DietPi-Installer WiFi selection](assets/images/dietpi-prep-wifiselection.png){: width="550" height="184" loading="lazy"}

The last selection is the target Debian version (the old **Buster**, current stable **Bullseye**, or next testing **Bookworm**).  
After this, the script runs a couple of minutes, finally the following message occurs:

![DietPi-Installer finish output](assets/images/dietpi-prep-finish.png){: width="550" height="113" loading="lazy"}

After this you can restart your system (`reboot`), alternatively you can copy the SC card (via `dd`) to an image (`.img`) to duplicate your base installation.

A further step can be to generate a compressed DietPi image via the [`dietpi-imager`](https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/blob/master/.build/images/dietpi-imager) script:

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaIng/DietPi/master/.build/images/dietpi-imager')"
```
